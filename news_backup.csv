From the Sunday sports enthusiast, the arm-chair commentator, to the serious athlete, all can now play, compete and volunteer.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. The inaugural Singapore National Games 2012 (SNG) was launched today on the sidelines of the Singapore River Regatta 2011. A new national community multi-sports competition to be held once every two years, the 2012 edition will pit community teams against each other in ten sports, with a trophy awarded to the overall champion of teams. The SNG will be jointly organised by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), People's Association (PA) and its grassroots organisations, as well as the National Sports Associations (NSA) of the ten sports in the inaugural SNG. It aims to be a meaningful and memorable sporting festival that ignites passion, builds character, connects people and bonds Singaporeans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 The Community Games, which now runs annually, will serve as the qualifying round for the SNG in the years when it is held. Next year, the Community Games will be held from March to July 2012 and the SNG will be held from 1 to 9 September 2012. The ten sports featured in 2012 are: Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Bowling, Dragon Boat, Football, Netball, Sepak Takraw, Swimming and Table Tennis. To bring the competitions to the heart of the community, the 2012 games will be held at various venues around Singapore, including schools, the Bedok Reservoir and the Singapore Sports School. Teams will be formed according to geographical clusters based on community groupings. Members of the winning teams will each be awarded a medal, with trophies being awarded to the winning teams.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4 Participation will be open to Singapore Citizens as well as non-Citizens, including Singapore Permanent Residents. National athletes are also eligible to compete. However in general, National athletes and non-citizens may only make up at most 20% of the team size, or one member of the team, whichever is higher. In order to encourage wide participation from all age groups and races, as well as residents living in both public and private estates, team composition for all sports have been formulated through discussion with the respective NSAs. With various team mix requirements, it is intended that more enthusiasts with different abilities will be able to be part of this nation-wide competition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5 Speaking at the launch, Mr Lim Swee Say, Minister to Prime Minister's Office and Deputy Chairman of the PA emphasised the inclusiveness of the Community Games and the Singapore National Games (referred collectively as ""the Games"").<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6 He said, ""Sports is not just about winning medals. It brings people together and unites them in a way that few other activities can. So it is as an important channel to unite residents of all age groups and races, from all estates within the community. We invite everyone to come together during the Singapore National Games, either to play a sport, support our teams in competition, or just enjoy the vibrant atmosphere. As we do so, we will increase our nation's social capital - which is about the strength of the connections and networks in our community.""<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7 Joining Minister Lim at the launch, Mr Chan Chun Sing, Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports, added, ""The Singapore National Games will be a unique event in Singapore's sports calendar, offering something for everyone. For participants, we can expect to see keen competition at all levels in all sports categories. For spectators and supporters, this will be a great opportunity to watch competitive sports, cheer on teams as well as be involved in the many fringe activities organised in conjunction with the Games. We hope this will help to bond the community and develop community sports heroes.""<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8 To demonstrate how the team format of the Games works, the Ministers participated in a friendly dragon boat race with teams subscribing to the rules of the Games.

This would provide something for all, from spectators, to supporters and other participants. By involving people from all walks of life, the Games will promote active and healthy living, as well as cultivate volunteerism in the community. In deciding the overall winner of each geographical cluster, the Games scoring and point system will extend beyond the actual competition in the field of play. The scoring system which will decide the overall champion will consider how their communities support their teams in addition to how their teams perform. Details of these criteria will be shared closer to the competitions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n10 The Singapore National Games is being organised by a Steering Committee comprising various stakeholders including representatives from the relevant NSAs, statutory boards, the Community Sports Clubs (CSCs) Council and the media. This is aimed at a consultative, inclusive approach in planning the Games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11 The inter-Constituency Games were renamed as the Community Games in February 2011 to reflect a more community-centric approach to engaging residents through sports. Organised by PA and the CSCs, and supported by SSC, the Community Games will continue to be organised during the years when SNG is not held. This will offer continued opportunities for mass participation and greater involvement of residents as participants, volunteers, supporters and officials in preparation for the SNG.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n12 Registration for the Games will be in two phases as some sports will not need a qualifying round. Registration for the Community Games 2012 will open in January 2012 for seven sports, while registration for the remaining three sports for the SNG 2012 will open in May 2012. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",<blank>,2011-12-01

All six projects involve collaborations between different funding partners who have come up with new and interesting ways to get communities involved in sport and recreation.<br />\r\nIn Taranaki, the New Plymouth District Council, BikeNZ and Sport Taranaki have joined forces to teach children the skills to ride a bike over a five-week course. Parents and caregivers will be given information about local cycle clubs and equipment such as child seats and trailers, while also being provided with information about pathways and cycle lanes in their area. At the end of the pilot, a toolkit of training resources will be made available throughout New Zealand and internationally so that other communities can run similar courses for pre-schoolers. <br />\r\nNew Plymouth has gained New Zealand Transport Authority funding to become a walking and cycling model community. The Let's Go model community project has funding for two years which is aimed at making walking and cycling the easiest transport choice for people in the area.<br />\r\nNew Plymouth mayor Harry Duynhoven says the Let's Go project has created a unique opportunity to push for increased participation in cycling and that is where SPARC's Active Communities funding has been targeted.<br />\r\n""If we can provide young kids with the opportunity to learn the skills they need to ride a bike, and ride it well, then we'll set them up for what could be a love of cycling they'll have all their lives. They will then be able to ride their bikes to school, cycle with their families and later take part in club cycling and other events,"" Mr Duynhoven says. <br />\r\n""Without this funding from SPARC, we wouldn’t have been able to press ahead with it.

There are plans to teach children a range of skills from learning how to paddle a waka and sail a yacht, to competing in a triathlon.<br />\r\n- Another project targets young adults aged 16 to 20 years, an age group where young people do sometimes drop out of sport and recreation after leaving school. In four low socioeconomic areas in Rotorua, there will be free sport and recreation activities at parks and reserves targeting that age group. This means they will be able to participate in sport and recreation activities without costly fees or transport to organise.<br />\r\n- In west Auckland a regional cycling hub is being created at the Auckland Council-owned Te Rangi Hiroa/Birdwood Reserve. Mountain bike tracks will be developed and the existing BMX track and skills park upgraded. The reserve is ideally located as a base point for road cycling in the Waitakere Ranges. <br />\r\n- In the Far North, a multi-purpose sports hub is being developed at Lindvart Park, Kaikohe where sport and recreation competitions, training and activities for a number of different sport codes will be run to get more young people and adults engaged in sport and recreation.<br />\r\n- In Nelson/Tasman district, there is an initiative to get more adults walking, running and cycling. Part of the plan revolves around entry level introductory programmes – including for learning cycling skills, monthly guided walks and rides, and a workplace initiative called Ride and Stride to get people on their feet or bikes. The aim is to give people more skills so they can go from entry level activities to club-based competitive participation so they can improve performance and enjoy new challenges.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",<blank>,2011-09-28

139,1,Fundamental Movement Skills Development Plan in Singapore,"The Singapore Sports Council (SSC) is laying the tracks that will take Singapore's sporting journey into a new era. The SSC's new Fundamental Movement Skills development programme will ensure that children in Singapore acquire the motor skills necessary to achieve physical literacy - the starting point towards the development of more specialised sports skills and the first step on the road to life-long active living. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SSC is working on a series of resource guides and training workshops, for preschool teachers, parents, and coaches of children aged two to 10. The resource guides will provide the information and practical know-how needed to develop fundamental movement skills in young children. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Fundamental Movement Skills development programme was unveiled at the official launch of 'FUN Start MOVE Smart!' Fundamental Movement Skills for Growing Active Learners - the first installment of the series. Targeted at childcare and preschool teachers, 'FUN Start MOVE Smart!', provides principles, ideas and practices to assist teachers in delivering motor development activities to drive physical literacy in children. It is the first work of its kind to be created in Singapore.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n""Teachers, parents and coaches are the greatest influences in a young child's life. We want to equip them with the correct tools they need to nurture a child’s innate urge for knowledge and, at the same time, enhance their development of physical capabilities. With ""FUN Start Move Smart!', childcare and preschool educators now have a standardised resource, developed specifically for local schools, to reference for all their movement education classes,"" said Dr Bervyn Lee, Senior Director, Sports Pathways Development, SSC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHe added, ""The realisation of this Fundamental Movement Skills development programme means that we have reached yet another milestone in the journey of Sporting Singapore. In the next five to 10 years, we will instill an entire generation with the physical capabilities to be successful in sports, be it at a competitive or recreational level. It is this generation of children that will take sports in Singapore to a whole new level.""<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhysical literacy is an attribute with life-long significance as it motivates people to establish a commitment to physical activity at a young age. It does not matter if the child aspires to be a professional footballer or is content playing friendly games with friends. In both cases, the child needs to have a solid foundation in fundamental movement skills if they are to be successful in their chosen pathway.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFundamental movement skills are also critical in the holistic development of young children in addition to being a potential springboard to sporting excellence. They are the building blocks for learning domains such as language, literacy, numeracy and social awareness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpressing her thoughts on the value this guide will add to the quality of preschool education in Singapore, Guest-of-honour Mdm Halimah Yacob, Minister of State, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports said, ""Children learn best through their own active involvement in the learning process. They grasp concepts and make sense of their surroundings by exploring and experiencing them for themselves. Through the Fundamental Movement Skills programme, we will enable our early childhood professionals to create a stimulating preschool environment where all children enjoy the opportunity to develop their physical literacy, which refers to the ability to understand, communicate, and apply different forms of movement, through this process of active exploration.""<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccompanying the resource guide is a one and a half day training workshop to guide teachers on effectively utilising, adapting and applying the principles and activity ideas in their daily lesson plans. In the first year, the SSC aims to train more than 700 teachers. Since March this year, 260 teachers have already taken up the SSC workshops.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe SSC is currently in the process of developing similar resources for parents and coaches, which will be launched in 2012 and 2013 respectively.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 'FUN Start MOVE Smart!' is developed as part of the Let's Play movement, an initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice, be it through playing, watching, cheering or volunteering for sports.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",<blank>,2011-07-06

With this in mind, the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) has urged the National Sports Associations (NSAs) to put in place strong and structured youth development programmes to groom our young athletes into the champions of tomorrow.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe Annual National Sports Association Grant Exercise (ANGE) for Financial Year (FY) 2011 (1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012) reflects this reality through a significant increase in funding for NSA development programmes. For FY 2011, a total of S$33.14 million in direct funding has been approved for 49 NSAs under ANGE FY2011 (ANGE FY2011), of which S$18.18 million (54.9% of the total amount) will be channelled towards developing a holistic athlete development structure and programming. This is an absolute year-on-year increase of 29.4% from the S$14.05 million of the total direct funding amount of S$32.3 million approved in FY 2010. As a percentage of the total direct allocation, development spending rose to 54.9% from only 43.9% the year before.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n""Singapore needs holistic youth development programmes to identify and groom our young sporting talent into the world champions of tomorrow. For Singapore to be a regular feature on the podium at the major Games like the Olympics, it will not be enough to concentre our efforts solely on the existing pool of elite athletes. It is thus crucial to ensure that Singapore has a pipeline of athletes ready to peak in 2012 and 2016, and beyond, "" said Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n""I am certain that with a structured, aggressive and holistic youth development system in place, we will continue to be represented on the podium at all of the major games in which our athletes participate,"" added SPS Teo.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nFor ANGE FY 2011, the SSC will be channelling a total of S$67.24 million to the NSAs and other sports partners. The amount includes direct grants of S$33.14 million and indirect grants of S$33.1 million. This is up from FY 2010's funding of S$54.17 million (Direct grant: $32.3 million; indirect grant: S$21.87 million).<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIndirect grants to NSAs include the Olympic Pathway Programme and Singapore Youth Sports Development funding, Sports Medicine and Sports Science support and subsidies for sports facilities, among others.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nContinued Investment in Team Sports<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe ANGE FY 2011 allocation also saw the SSC continue their investment in Team Sports. About $8.32 million, up from $8.11 million in FY 2010, will be allocated towards Team Sports.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe importance of Team Sports was explained by Mr Richard Seow, Chairman, SSC, who noted, ""If we want to be masters of our sporting destiny, we need to get more of our youth into sports at an earlier age. Not only do team sports produce champions, they are a great way to build the social skills we need in life. These young athletes have the potential to become our leaders of tomorrow. Team sports teach youth about sharing responsibility in both victory and defeat, pursuing a group strategy and team problem-solving in real time.""<br />\r\n <br />\r\nFootball and Water Polo will see an increase in funding this year. The funding to the Football Association of Singapore is for development programmes for the men's under-16, 17 and 18 teams to help them prepare for the 2013 and 2015 SEA Games. The boost in funding for Water Polo is to assist the men's and women's teams' preparations for the 26th SEA Games 2011. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",<blank>,2011-02-25

For the first time in Trinidad & Tobago, and then in Iran, groups of national Sport for All leaders were invited to a national CLC. Port of Spain and Tehran served as venues for this unique qualification program hosted by the ""First Citizens Sport Foundation"" and the ""Iran Sport for All Association"".

Appreciation also goes to all the national and international speakers with Nicolas Valgoni from Argentina as a newcomer to the CLC program.<br />\r\nTAFISA Certified Leadership Courses in Sport for All were developed to train and qualify national Sport for All leaders around the globe. In 2010, the International Olympic Committee signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TAFISA to further develop the CLC program.  Part of this development included the implementation of a National CLC scheme in addition to the International CLC.  These courses are specifically for the development of Sport for All leaders in a TAFISA Member's or NOC's country. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",1358916558.jpg,2011-02-11

165,3,"""FUN Start, MOVE Smart!"" Launched in Singapore","Children in Singapore will now receive a holistic education right from preschool with the launch of ""FUN Start, MOVE Smart! The FUNdamental MOVEment Skills for Growing Active Learners"" developed by the Singapore Sports Council (SSC).<br />\r\n <br />\r\n""FUN Start, MOVE Smart!"" is a resource guide that provides teaching principles, ideas and practices to help educators in their movement education classes. Specifically, the guide provides educators basic information on fundamental movement skills, recommended activities, safety tips, and ideas on integrating the skills with other domains of development. There are also several instructional tools such as cue cards and observational checklists included for educators to use. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nFundamental movement skills are critical in the holistic development of children aged two to ten and are the building blocks for all learning domains such as language, literacy, numeracy and social awareness. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nSaid Dr Bervyn Lee, Senior Director, Sports Pathways Development Division, SSC, ""We recognise that fundamental movement skills are not age-determined but ability-driven. While the initial phase of the roll-out is focused on preschools, the teaching of fundamental movement skills is essential in our primary schools too."" <br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe guide is written by Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang, an Associate Professor in Physical Education and Sports Science at the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the Nanyang Technogical University (NTU). She added, ""People often assume that fundamental movement skills will develop naturally as the child grows. However, these skills have to be taught just like reading or writing. Fundamental movement skills are also crucial perquisites for the child to master more complex and specialised sports skills, for a healthy, active lifestyle later in adulthood.""<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe SSC will distribute about 1,400 complimentary copies of ""FUN Start, MOVE Smart!"" to all preschools in Singapore by early 2011. About 30 early childhood educators from up to 10 schools will also be participating in a pilot programme that will run from January to March 2011, where the guide will be put into practice and the results of its use will be monitored.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIn addition, a series of training workshops targeting an initial 300 early childhood educators will also be conducted, commencing first quarter of next year. Lessons learnt and feedback received during the pilot programme will be used to frame the structure these workshops. The workshops will give educators a deeper understanding of the importance of helping children acquire fundamental movement skills, as well as guide teachers on how to best utilise the resource guide. In the first year, the Singapore Sports Council plans to reach out to more than 700 teachers, benefitting about 15,000 preschoolers.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAdded Dr Bervyn Lee, ""The SSC's aim is to give every young child in Singapore every opportunity to be competent physically. In doing so, we will be assisting the development of physical literacy, which is the foundation for an active and healthy lifestyle, sports performance, and better-rounded individuals.""<br />\r\n <br />\r\nAcknowledging the importance of the teaching of fundamental movement skills in preschools, the long term benefits and strong positive results achieved in countries like Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the SSC plans to further scale the programme by providing parents and sports coaches with a similar guide in the near future. <br />\r\n <br />\r\nThe ""FUN Start, MOVE Smart! The FUNdamental MOVEment Skills for Growing Active Learners Resource Guide"" is developed as part of the Let's Play movement, an initiative by the SSC to encourage all Singaporeans to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice, be it through playing, watching, cheering or volunteering for sports.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n",<blank>,2010-11-30

188,0,$325 Million Boost to Sport & Getting More Australians Active,"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Australian Government will boost the number of Australians \r\nparticipating in sport and drive Australia's continued sporting success through \r\nthe delivery of $324.8 million ongoing funding. '<i>Australian Sport: \r\nThe Pathway to Success</i>' is backed by $195.2 million in new funding – the \r\nbiggest funding injection to sport in our nation's history.The Rudd \r\nGovernment will invest a record $1.2 billion in sport over the next four years, \r\nbuilding on our $300 million boost to community sporting facilities in 2009, the \r\nsingle largest investment in community sporting infrastructure that this country \r\nhas ever seen. Australia has always been at the forefront of innovation \r\nand doing things differently to ensure our competitive edge when it comes to \r\nsport. What has become clear is that our approach to sport has stagnated \r\nover the past decade, resulting in stunted participation rates, skyrocketing \r\nobesity numbers and an emerging decline in our international sporting \r\nperformances.The Rudd Government is forging a new way forward for \r\nAustralian sport. '<i>Australian Sport: The Pathway to Success</i>' \r\ndelivers on the Rudd Government’s commitment to boost funding to both community \r\nand elite sport.For the first time, it also delivers significant \r\ninvestment to the all-important development pathway - the vital link connecting \r\ngrassroots and high performance sport.The Australian Government’s \r\nwhole-of-sport approach focuses on delivering in three key areas:\r\n1. Increasing the number of Australians participating in sport 2. \r\nStrengthening sporting pathways 3. Striving for success\r\nSpecific initiatives under these three areas include:<b>Delivering \r\nthe first Sport and Education Strategy</b> to bring a new focus on the delivery \r\nof quality sport in schools and boost the number of our children participating \r\nin sport.R<b>equiring National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) to have an \r\nincreased focus on participation outcomes</b> as part of their funding \r\nagreements with the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and boosting funding \r\nopportunities for NSOs to grow grassroots participation through direct grants to \r\ncommunity clubs.<b>Delivering a National Sport and Active Recreation \r\nPolicy Framework</b> that will for the first time enable a co-ordinated, \r\nwhole-of-sport approach to sport from Commonwealth and State and Territory \r\nGovernments.<b>Additional coaching and officiating training \r\nopportunities</b> for up to 45,000 community coaches and officials, and \r\nsubsidise the costs associated with training for 5,000 new community coaches and \r\nofficials.<b>Investing in the development pathway</b> by doubling the \r\nLocal Sporting Champion program to support 8,000 junior athletes to participate \r\nin competition; and boosting opportunities for up and coming athletes to compete \r\nin domestic competition. <b>Doubling our talent identification \r\nprogram</b> to support 10,000 aspiring Australian athletes and employ more \r\ntalent scouts.<b>Requiring Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) \r\nScholarship holders</b> to volunteer at local community sporting clubs or junior \r\nsport programs. <b>Boosting funding to identify, attract, develop and \r\nretain our high performance coaches</b> including support for incentive packages \r\nand professional development.<b>Expanding funding support to our high \r\nperformance athletes</b> to support their training and participation in \r\ninternational competition. <b>Re-aligning our high performances \r\ninstitutions and academies</b> in a landmark partnership with State and \r\nTerritories that will deliver a more cohesive system for sporting \r\nexcellence.The Rudd Government will also deliver a $324.8 million \r\ninvestment into the ASC funding base to create a secure platform to plan beyond \r\nBudget cycles.In particular, this will assist in better preparation for \r\nmajor events such as the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. This \r\nsignificant suite of reforms represents the largest reform of Australian sport \r\nin three decades.It will boost the number of Australians participating \r\nin sport, especially our children, while positioning Australia to continue to \r\nshine on the international stage. In recognition of the significant \r\nleadership role played by the ASC, Australia's peak national sport agency will \r\nbe tasked with implementing '<i>Australian Sport: The Pathway to Success'</i> \r\nand distributing funding. The Rudd Government’s vision for sport not \r\nonly brings a new strategic focus, but also helps equip our community to tackle \r\nthe health and ageing challenges we face in the 21st \r\ncentury.",<blank>,2010-05-18

193,0,The Strategic Direction of Malaysian Sports - Clubs as the solid foundation,"<b>By Encik Wan Yew Leong, former President of Pacesetters Athletic Club \r\nMalaysia.</b><b>OCM Conference to formulate OCM’s Strategic Plan \r\n2011-2016</b> The Executive Board of Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) \r\ndecided that a strategic plan be formulated to chart the progress of OCM over \r\nthe next 5 years. This task has been given to the Strategic Planning Committee \r\nchaired by the Deputy President, Y.Bhg. Datuk Dr. M. Jegathesan. The process of \r\nformulating the five year plan will start with a Conference with the Theme ""From \r\n'good' to 'great' – taking OCM to New Heights"".\xa0I find that the term ""sports development"" is not well understood as it usually \r\nrefers to the churning out athletes in high performance sports. I feel sports \r\ndevelopment should be broad base, introducing & promoting the sports to \r\nindividuals, from the young to the old, from those with more natural talent to \r\nthose with lesser capabilities. This is where I feel failure among most NSAs. \r\nNSAs are very medals focused, measured by number of gold medals in regional \r\ngames and I feel they could be obsessed with it at times. In their mission and \r\ngoals, sports for all are excluded. <b>Of Foundation, Clubs and Sports \r\nfor All</b>I like to comment on the role of clubs in sports development and \r\ninculcating sports for all. I was at the OCM Museum during the recent OCM Youth \r\nLeadership Conference and I saw on chart that I reproduce here to show the \r\nrelationship of the sports structure globally.<b>Sports\xa0</b>Having taken a helicopter view from 30,000 feet above sea level, let's try to go \r\nto the ground and see what's happening. Since I am a recreational runner, I \r\nwould use athletics as the example. Sports governance exists for the purpose of \r\nthe sports to serve the athletes. The athletes usually are individuals or \r\nmembers of a sports club, in my case I am a member of Pacesetters Athletic Club, \r\nMalaysia.(PACM) PACM, in turn belongs to Federal Territory Amateur Athletic \r\nAssociation (FTAAA) which is the state sports association (SSA) for athletics \r\ngoverning the sports. FTAAA is affiliated to Malaysian Amateur Athletic Union \r\n(MAAU) (http://maau.net.blog) the national sports association governing \r\nathletics in Malaysia. MAAU is the only recognized athletic body in Malaysia \r\nthat is affiliated to International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) \r\n(http://www.iaaf.org), the global body governing athletics. At the same time, \r\nMAAU is also affiliated to OCM, the coordinating body for all national sports \r\nassociations. IAAF and OCM along with all other International Federations of \r\nother sports and various National Olympic Associations are affiliated to the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee (www.olympic.org) , based in Switzerland.The \r\nvision, mission and goal of MAAU are as \r\nfollows;<i><b>VISION</b>The heartbeat of world-class athletics in \r\nthe region<b>MISSION</b> To develop, produce and manage \r\ncompetitive world-class athletes who excel at the regional and world meets in \r\norder to bring honours to the country.<b>GOALS</b>Produce \r\nworld-class athletes who excel at regional and world meets by 2012Develop, \r\nproduce and maintain a strong back-up squad at all times.In close \r\ncooperation with NSC, set up centres of excellence with the necessary \r\ninfrastructure that cater for the needs of athletes by 2008.Implement a high \r\nperformance athletics system by 2006.In close cooperation with NSC, \r\nestablish a national sports science centre and related sport science system by \r\n2010</i>While this article is not intended to critic MAAU’s Vision \r\nMission statement, I can't help but find the sports for all piece is totally \r\nmissing from the goals, it is all about high performance sports. I wonder \r\nwhether sports for all are in the State AAAs’ goals. This perhaps partly \r\nexplains the missing link in the sports clubs as sports clubs tend to be more \r\nrecreational rather than high performance. Now why do I take so much \r\npain to explain the relationship? It is my intention to dwell with the substance \r\nand form of this governing structure. The fundamental role of the NSAs is to \r\ngovern and promote their sports. Therefore, if a certain sport in a country is \r\nnot doing well, the buck stops at the NSA. In Malaysia, the NSAs promote their \r\nsports via the SSAs. This is where the problem lies, not all the SSAs are \r\ncapable or active. Of course due consideration has to be given to small states \r\nlike Perlis as compared to large state like Selangor, the population of the \r\nstates, their demography will determine the popularity of the sports. Within the \r\nstates we have the districts sports activities promoted by the state sports \r\ncouncils. The membership of the SSA is from the sports clubs. The strength and \r\nweakness clearly lies in the sports clubs. In many sports, especially in \r\nathletics, the clubs are few. Just use FTAAA as an example, I recall FTAAA \r\nhaving more than 130 affiliates of various clubs and associations back in the \r\neighties when even my old boys association was a member. Now FTAAA has about 30 \r\naffiliates and even these affiliates are by and large inactive. FTAAA is \r\nconsidered one of the strongest SSAs and you can imagine the situation in the \r\nsmaller states. This problem is repeated in many other sports where the vacuum \r\nis greatly felt at the demise of the sports clubs, in short, the SSAs are \r\nhollow! A few years ago when we have Datuk Azalina as Sports Minister, the \r\nrevival of the sports clubs is very much talk about at national level. However, \r\nthe status of the issue is that we talked about it, nothing more! We can say \r\ntoday we have a big vacuum at the SSAs and the clubs. The role of the \r\nclubs is not just about development of sports at high performance level but \r\nfulfill the very important role of promoting sports for all, an equally \r\nimportant objective of OCM along with high performance sports. They also form a \r\nconduit for school leavers to further their sporting activities after they left \r\nschools. Tunku Imran, president of OCM spoke passionately that he rather sees 2 \r\nmillion individuals running than having 5 gold medals. I would put in another \r\nway, if we have 2 million individuals running recreationally, we already have \r\nthe cake. Should we also win the SEA Games Marathon gold medal, we then have the \r\nicing on the cake. Could you imagine having 2 million individuals running? It \r\nmeans that we become a healthier nation with fewer problems from lifestyle \r\ndiseases. We would move closer to a sporting culture like in Australia. \r\n<b>Examples of Grass Root Development </b>I do have a little story \r\nto share on the role of clubs with Michelle Tan Bee Kiang as the case study. In \r\n2000 and 2001 when Michele was in Form 4 and 5, she ran with the Pacesetters \r\nYouth Program at Kampung Pandan under the guidance of Viviene Kartsounis and KK \r\nOon. She did not have family support in pursuit of the sports. The club played a \r\nrole here and she was supported via the New Balance Racing Team program as a \r\nback-up runner. On Sundays for the long runs, members of the Permaisuri Group \r\nsuch as Phoon Yoke Heng and a few others provided her with the transport to \r\nBukit Aman Car-park where the Pacesetters train for their long runs. She took \r\npart in both the track and road events with some modest achievements. She wrote \r\nabout her experience with the club in her article, ""Thoughts of a young \r\nPacesetter"" (Footloose January 2001)I recall she joined me to run at a \r\nroad race in Perak in 2001. On the way back, Jenny Lim (PACM ladies captain \r\nthen) hitched a ride from us and while in my vehicle, Jenny advised her ""You \r\nhave strong legs, you should be able to train harder and improve"" Michelle left \r\nthe club after her Form 5 and further her studies in LLB. After her LLB, she \r\nre-emerged in the club and started training with the better runners, including \r\nthe African runners. Today she is one of the top 3 runners in the women open \r\ncategory for marathon and 21km with a personal best time of 3hr 45mins for the \r\nmarathon. The club cannot claim credit for her current achievements but the club \r\ndid provided her a niche during her formative years when she was in Form 4 and \r\n5; that is factual. Another story I wish to share is on my third \r\ndaughter, Karen. In her younger days, she is kind of a softie among my 4 girls. \r\nHer school in Subang Jaya is like any other schools now, rushing off their \r\nsports activities by the first few months of the year to focus on producing As \r\nin the public exams. She was lucky to get associated with a former basketball \r\nplayer turned coach by the name of Gary. He has the passion for the sports and \r\ngathered about 20 girls from a few schools to provide them the basic training \r\nwith the intention to form a girl team for local competitions such as the \r\nJasmine Cup. Over the last 2 years I witnessed her improvement in the sports and \r\nshe ended by representing her district in the Inter-district Under 18 Basketball \r\nCompetition, her team came out runners-up in 2009. In my housing area, Subang \r\nJaya we also have a group of individuals who raise funds with some help from \r\nDatuk Lee Hwa Beng, assembly man of Subang Jaya then and MPSJ to build a covered \r\nbasketball court in USJ14. This covered court comes with lights and can host \r\ntournaments without interruption by the weather. I appreciate the effort of this \r\ngroup of individuals and Gary towards providing my daughter and many kids in \r\nSubang Jaya an opportunity to play basketball beyond what the school can cater. \r\n<b>Build the Foundation</b>These two grass root stories gave hope \r\ntowards a sporting culture and there are groups and individuals out there \r\nwilling to contribute to sports mainly due to their passion for it. The SSAs \r\nneed to engage with these groups, clubs and individuals and give them the \r\nappropriate support. Engagement with them via membership, affiliation, \r\ncommunication will be a good start towards building up a strong representation \r\nof the sports at district / state level. The SSAs should provide incubator \r\nservice (helping clubs through the formative stage) to encourage more clubs to \r\nbe formed and get affiliated to them to create a wider base of both recreational \r\nand high performance sports practitioners.

The significant \r\noccasion was attended by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community \r\nDevelopment, Youth and Sports; Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, \r\nMinistry of Community Development, Youth and Sports and Ministry of Transport \r\nSingapore; as well as Team Singapore youth athletes such as Adam Goh \r\n(Basketball); Terence Choo (Sailing); Abel Lim (Shooting); Amanda Lim (Swimming) \r\nand Chau Hai Qing (Table Tennis). \r\nUnder the MOU, the SSC and MILO will be working closely on multiple \r\nsynergistic programmes and platforms, all contributing towards youth sports \r\npromotion and development. The MOU will be completed in three phases, beginning \r\nfrom February till December 2010, with Singapore's favourite energy drink, MILO \r\npledging more than S$3 million in cash and kind, with substantial investment in \r\nactivation programmes. The MOU marks MILO's 60th year in its advocacy on the \r\ndevelopment of youth sports in Singapore.\r\nExpressing his thoughts on the partnership, Mr Oon Jin Teik, CEO of the SSC \r\nsaid, ""Singapore's young people under the age of 25 account for about one-third \r\nof our population, according to the latest data available. This 1.16 \r\nmillion-strong demographic will be our next generation of elite athletes, \r\ncoaches, officials, volunteers, administrators and visionaries. They will ensure \r\nthe expansion and self-sustainability of our sports sector. Hence, we need to \r\nprepare them to take on these roles for Singapore. I firmly believe that this \r\npartnership with MILO will be a huge step in helping us shape the youth of today \r\nfor tomorrow's sporting needs.""\r\nThrough MILO and SSC's partnership, both organisations will be rolling out \r\nactivities under three phases in 2010 - Inspiring Singapore, Cheering Singapore \r\nand Legacy Singapore. \r\nInspiring Singapore will start immediately with MILO supporting about 490 \r\nathletes across 26 Olympic sports, with all the athletes and NSAs receiving \r\nabout S$200,000 from this partnership. The second phase, Cheering Singapore will \r\nsee the launch of activities to rally Singaporeans to cheer on their athletes \r\nand support them for the upcoming major games. Finally, Legacy Singapore will \r\ncelebrate and congratulate the performance of athletes, with plans to launch \r\nsatellite centres for each of the 26 Olympic sports to promote sports \r\ndevelopment in youths, further advocating MILO's ""Play More, Learn More"" \r\ncampaign this year, championing learning values such as confidence, \r\nsportsmanship, respect and other lessons gained from an active sporting \r\nlifestyle.\r\nOther plans in the pipeline include the production and launch of an \r\n8-episode reality sports programme, featuring youth contestants where they will \r\nhave to use their wits, skills and physical strength to compete against one \r\nanother in a series of fun sporting activities. The programme will be \r\nbroadcasted on Starhub's Super Sports Arena Channel from 23 May 2010.\r\nA great supporter and active participant in sports development in Singapore \r\nsince the 1950s, MILO has consistently contributed to a sporting nation, through \r\nthe sponsorship of various popular sports such as track and field, swimming, \r\nbasketball and soccer. The household name has also supported partnerships with \r\nthe Ministry of Education (MOE), the SSC and People's Association, strengthening \r\nits position as a strong advocate of sports and an active and healthy \r\nlifestyle.\r\nMr Suresh Narayanan, Managing Director of Nestle Singapore, expressed his \r\nenthusiasm for the new campaign, ""We firmly believe that an active lifestyle \r\nthrough sports is an excellent avenue for youths to pick up key values and \r\nattitudes towards life, equipping them with the mindset and life skills that \r\ncannot be picked up from books. As we celebrate about 60 years of MILO's \r\ninvolvement with sports development in Singapore, we are honoured to be able to \r\ncommemorate our involvement and commitment to the community through this \r\npartnership with the SSC. Sports is a wonderful platform for our youths to learn \r\nimportant values such as honesty, teamwork, fair play, respect, adherence to \r\nrules, discipline, perseverance, resilience and a strong sense of purpose and we \r\nhope this partnership will further engage the youth in Singapore and develop \r\nthem to their full potential.""\r\nThe VIPs, students from Seng Kang Primary and Team Singapore youth athletes \r\ncommemorated the MOU with an exciting telematch.

202,1,Youngsters in Qatar talk about their experience of the ground-breaking Schools Olympic Programme,"The third edition of Schools Olympic Program (SOP) under the theme ""Sport \r\n& Culture"" is great. Qatar's Schools Olympic Programme has already been \r\nspoken of with admiration and enthusiasm by the Olympic Movement, National \r\nOlympic Committees and former track stars like Carl Lewis, who have devoted \r\ntheir time to using sport to improve the lives of young people. \r\nSome of the participating students tell their stories about the program. \r\nThey were asked about the level of change in their school's sporting life since \r\nthe programme was launched - and about the way they see their sporting future \r\nand that of Qatar in the coming years.\r\nThe Qatari student Haya Jamal Al Hitmi is in Year 9 at Qatar Intermediate \r\nSchool for girls. She plays in the handball team which represented the school in \r\nSOP competitions and won the gold medal last season.\r\nThe Schools Olympic Programme, she says, gave her the opportunity she had \r\nbeen waiting for to satisfy her love for her favourite sport, handball, as she \r\ncould train more and develop her skills. Haya thinks that this programme ""is \r\nmuch better than what was going on previously, since it provides youth with the \r\nopportunity to practice their interests, not only in sport but also in many \r\nother cultural and artistic domains, due to the various accompanying activities \r\norganised during the programme.""\r\nMuawiya Abdulrahman a student at Al Ahnaf Bin Qais Intermediate Independent \r\nSchool for boys, says he has noticed an important improvement in school sports \r\nsince the launch of the Schools Olympic Programme. ""This improvement appeared \r\nmainly in the greater number of events and matches. The students have more \r\nopportunities to practice and develop their skills and experience by playing \r\nmany more matches and participating in many more races, especially for those who \r\nare talented and have a chance to progress. At the same time, competitions are \r\nrunning in an atmosphere of fun between students of various schools.""\r\nMeanwhile, Ali Hassan Al Jassim of the same Al Ahnaf Bin Qais Intermediate \r\nIndependent School for boys, says ""Competitions dramatically increased in \r\nnumber, and were organised in a better way and in an appropriate atmosphere for \r\nenhancing our technical levels as well as the commitment to discipline and fair \r\nplay.""\r\nAli Hassan, moreover, does not think that practicing sport affects his \r\nstudies since academic success at school remains of highest priority for the \r\nfuture of the student. ""The student should devote the same interest to his \r\nstudies as his sport activities until he finishes his secondary studies. Then, \r\nif he and his PE teachers or coaches are sure that he has the talent for a \r\nsuccessful career in sport, he could dedicate more time and effort to his \r\nsport.""",<blank>,2010-02-04

We know that cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and diabetes \r\naccount for one-quarter of Australia's burden of disease and almost two-thirds \r\nof all deaths. </p>\r\n<p>Through COAG the Government has committed $872 million for health promotion \r\nand preventative health - the largest commitment ever of an Australian \r\nGovernment. Through this National Partnership with the states, the Rudd \r\nGovernment continues to support practical solutions to these growing problems. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>$72 million is available to support Local Government Areas (LGAs) in \r\ndelivering effective community-based physical activity and dietary education \r\nprograms, as well as developing a range of policy environments to support \r\nhealthy lifestyle behaviours. </p>\r\n<p>The Healthy Communities Initiative aims to help reduce the prevalence of \r\noverweight and obesity within participating communities by maximising the number \r\nof at-risk individuals engaged in physical activity and dietary education \r\nprograms. The initiative will target individuals at a high risk of developing \r\nchronic disease and not predominantly in the paid workforce. </p>\r\n<p>The Government has now invited 42 LGAs from across the country to apply for \r\nfunding under the pilot phase of this initiative. 12 will be chosen, focusing on \r\nareas with higher than average rates of obesity and social disadvantage. </p>\r\n<p>The 12 pilot grants in this innovative and practical program will be awarded \r\nin early 2010, with 92 sites across the four years of the program. </p>\r\n<p>The establishment of a National Preventative Health Agency is another key \r\ncomponent of the Government's prevention strategy. Incredibly, this weapon in \r\nthe Government's fight against obesity, chronic disease and alcohol and tobacco \r\naddiction has been stalled in the Senate by the Opposition. \r\n</p>",<blank>,2009-12-18

'The \r\nprogram is essentially about building the capacity of local sports federations \r\nto deliver what the partner countries have identified as most important to them, \r\nincluding some specific development outcomes in the area of social health \r\ninitiatives and youth engagement'.</p>\r\n<p>To implement the Pacific sports partnerships program, the partners will work \r\ntogether to share resources, strategies and programs. The aim is to promote \r\ncollaboration and improve participation pathways for players, administrators, \r\ncoaches and officials.</p>\r\n<p>The initial development of the partnership is a three-step process. First, \r\neach organization does an audit of their capacity, concerns and reasons for \r\nbeing interested in the partnership. Second, the organizations come together to \r\ndevelop a partnership agreement that outlines the shared interests and the way \r\nthe partnership will be managed. Third, the agencies involved in the \r\nimplementation of the activities come together to develop a work plan that \r\ndescribes how the activities will run.</p>\r\n<p>'This approach is different to grants we have had from organizations,' said \r\nTai Nichols, secretary-general of Oceanic Football Confederation. 'In this \r\npartnership, each organization has a role to play and has to be really aware of \r\nwhat they can contribute and why they are keen to be part of the team.'</p>\r\n<p>Although it is early in the partnership process, Roberts is excited about the \r\nprogram. 'It will see significant delivery of sport for development programs in \r\na range of sports throughout the Oceania region building on the successful work \r\nof the Australian Sports Outreach Program and the sports federations in the \r\nPacific region'.</p>",<blank>,2009-11-10

221,0,Sport for All - Participation Patterns of Hong Kong People in Physical Activities consultancy study findings unveiled,"<p>\xa0A consultancy study, ""Sport for All - Participation Patterns of Hong Kong \r\nPeople in Physical ctivities"", commissioned by the Community Sports Committee of \r\nthe Sports Commission revealed that over 60% of the respondents (65.5%) \r\nindicated they have participated in sports for at least once during the three \r\nmonths of survey period. The study, successfully interviewed more than 5 000 \r\nrespondents, found that the male participation rate in sports is 68.4%, slightly \r\nhigher than the 62.9% for the female. The survey also showed that with the \r\nincrease in age, the sport participation rate dropped significantly from 95.6% \r\n(aged 7 to 12) to 53.3% (aged 60 or above).</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 On the frequency of sports participation, 41.2% of the \r\nrespondents (27.0% of the population) indicated that they had participated in \r\nsports three times or more per week, and 80.3% (52.6% of the population) for at \r\nleast once per week. The sports they participated in most frequently were \r\njogging (13.8%), swimming (13.2%) and badminton (10.1%). The three sports they \r\nwere most eager to learn were swimming (14.7%), tai chi (10.3%) and badminton \r\n(8.8%).</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 More than half of the respondents (60.6%) used mainly \r\nthe leisure facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) or \r\nother government departments. The first three considerations for the people to \r\nchoose a sport to learn were ""interest"" (40.7%), ""keeping fit/health"" (21.3%) \r\nand ""time available"" (11.6%). ""Facilities"" (4.8%) and ""cost"" (2.9%) were not \r\ntheir primary considerations.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 About half of the respondents (46.9%) usually played \r\nsports with friends/ neighbours, 40.8% played sports alone and 13.1% with \r\nclassmates.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 Apart from studying people's sport participation \r\npattern, the study also covered their participation in physical activities. \r\n""Physical activities"" refers to all physical activities that consume energy, \r\nincluding daily activities such as walking, housework, gardening and job-related \r\nmanual work, and sports which require physical exertion and skills for the \r\nimprovements of health and physique.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 The study revealed that over half (51.4%) of the Hong \r\nKong people failed to meet the level of the ""baseline indicator"" of physical \r\nactivity level. The ""baseline indicator"" is set at a level of as least an \r\naccumulation of 30 minutes a day and at least three days a week in moderate or \r\nvigorous physical activities. ""Moderate intensity activities"" refer to physical \r\nactivities that slightly speed up one's breathing and heart rate and cause mild \r\nsweating without feeling exhausted, and that is still in a state of capable of \r\ntalking smoothly. Examples are brisk walk, jogging, walking stairs, slow cycling \r\nor dancing.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 The primary reasons for the respondents' participation \r\nin physical activities included ""keeping fit/health"" (35.9%), ""interest"" (12.9%) \r\nand ""physical activities/sports is a habit in daily life"" (11.6%). The reasons \r\nfor not taking the initiative in participating in physical activities included \r\n""no spare time due to work/study"" (30.7%), ""tired"" (17.5%) and ""lazy"" \r\n(14.6%).</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 More than half of the respondents (57.4%), especially \r\nthe younger ones aged seven to 12 (72%) or the elderly aged 60 or above (77.7%) \r\nconsidered that they had sufficient or very sufficient amount of physical \r\nactivities. However, if measured by the ""baseline indicator"", only 48.6% of the \r\npeople reached the activity level of the ""baseline indicator"". It showed that \r\nthere was a significant gap between self-evaluation and objective assessment on \r\nthe amount of physical activities.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 The consultancy study ""Sport for All - Participation \r\nPatterns of Hong Kong People in Physical Activities"" was conducted in two \r\nstages, namely literature review and questionnaire survey.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 The LCSD appointed the Department of Sports Science \r\nand Physical Education of The Chinese University of Hong Kong as the consultant \r\nin September 2007 to undertake a literature review, supervise the implementation \r\nof the survey and prepare a comprehensive final report. The Literature review \r\nbegan in January 2008 with the collection of sports development data and related \r\nstudies of Hong Kong and ten countries/regions.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 In April 2008, the LCSD appointed the Consumer Search \r\nto conduct a household survey for the second stage of the study. The survey was \r\ncarried out from May 22 to July 10, 2008 (first phase), followed by other \r\ncarried out from September 2 to October 19, 2008 (second phase).</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 More than 5 000 people were successfully interviewed. \r\nOf the total respondents, 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female, matching the \r\ngender distribution of Hong Kong's population.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 Speaking at the press conference held today (September \r\n2) to announce the findings of the survey, the Chairman of the Community Sports \r\nCommittee (CSC), Mr Chau How-chen, said the CSC endorsed six strategies for \r\npromoting community sports. One of them is to formulate objective indicators to \r\nmeasure the effectiveness of the promotion of Sport for All in the community. \r\nThrough the conduction of a large-scale study, information on the extent, \r\nfrequency and other data on the participation patterns of Hong Kong people in \r\nphysical activities were collected so as to objectively measure the level of \r\npenetration of Sport for All in the community. The purpose is for a better grasp \r\nof the updated information of people's participation in physical activities so \r\nas to serve as references for formulating community sports strategies in the \r\nfuture. He emphasised that as far as promotion of Sport for All was concerned, \r\nthis study is one of the important achievements of the six \r\nstrategies.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 A task force, formed under the CSC with Dr Lo Wing-lok \r\nas convener, was responsible for survey-related issues. Speaking at today's \r\npress conference, Dr Lo said that the data collected by the study, particularly \r\ninformation on physical activities and the ""baseline indicator"", were valuable \r\nreferences for future promotion work of community sports.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 Based on the findings, the CSC proposed cooperation \r\namong the stakeholders in the community to disseminate the message on the \r\nimportance of regular participation in sport and other physical activities. It \r\nwas also proposed to review the provision of a greater variety of leisure \r\nactivities and facilities for the public with a view to achieving the objective \r\nof Sport for All.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 Speaking at the press conference about the follow-up \r\naction, Assistant Director of LCSD, Miss Olivia Chan, said that based on the \r\nfindings, the CSC proposed that to further promote Sports for All in the \r\ncommunity, emphasis should be made to ""education"" and ""service"". Through \r\neducation and upgrading services from time to time, more people will be \r\nencouraged to actively participate in sports and physical activities.</p>\r\n<p>\xa0\xa0\xa0 She said that follow up action will be taken into two \r\nphases. The first phase will focus on introducing the findings of the study to \r\nvarious stakeholders including government departments, District Councils, \r\nNational Sports Associations (NSAs), district sports associations, business \r\norganisations and schools; enlist their support to promote ""Sport for All"" in \r\nthe community; and to disseminate messages on the importance of regular \r\nparticipation in sport and other physical activities to the public through \r\nvarious channels.

There was even a special appearance by the Enviro-buzz, a joint \r\ncollaboration between the Northeast CDC and the NEA (National Environmental \r\nAgency) who co-sponsored the event.</p>\r\n<p>The run, with 3200 participants in total featured varying running distances \r\nranging from 2km to 10km. However, unlike past runs, a unique feature of the \r\nrace was the different categories that the participants could take part in. To \r\nforge greater community bonding, new pair combinations have been introduced such \r\nas siblings, couple, friends and even neighbor pairings.\xa0</p>\r\n<p>Aside from the competitive races, the Suburban @ North East Run 2009 proved \r\nto be a truly heartwarming sight. Scenes of parents encouraging their children \r\non during the race are touching. The race brought out the true affection and \r\nlove that partners had for each other and it was really moving to see them \r\ncheering each other on after such a long and arduous journey.</p>\r\n<p>Miss Ke Rui, a female participant after the prize presentation ceremony had \r\nsome comments to share, ""I really enjoyed the run together with my friends! This \r\nevent was really well-organized, logistics and all"" she said.</p>\r\n<p>Careful planning was evidently true as volunteers and organizers alike were \r\nwell located throughout the entire 10km track to provide ample water points as \r\nwell as to cheer the runners on.</p>\r\n<p>In a nutshell, the success of this well-organized event not only stemmed from \r\nthe various objectives that were achieved, but also from the encouragement and \r\ncare shown by all the participants. In a way, it reflects the saying whereby \r\ntough times bring out the best within people.</p>",<blank>,2009-03-24

This is the Singapore Sports Council \r\n(SSC)'s call-out to all Singaporeans - the young, the elderly, working adults, \r\nfamilies and the disabled. ""Let's Play"" is a nation-wide movement initiated by \r\nthe SSC to promote a mindset change and encourage everyone in Singapore to be \r\ninvolved in sports, in all ways, at all times, simply because they enjoy it. It \r\nsupports various initiatives to promote a sporting culture. The 'Let's Play' \r\nbrand aims to trigger the emotions of all Singaporeans to increase their \r\ninterest to participate in sports for a variety of reasons, because ""sports \r\nenergises life through its diverse offer of enjoyable moments and shared \r\nexperiences"".\r\n\xa0\r\n'Let's Play' was launched by Mr Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary \r\nSecretary for Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and \r\nTransport (MOT) at Suntec City today. Mr Teo said, ""While sports participation \r\nrates are at an all time high (48% in 2005), research conducted by SSC's brand \r\nconsultants showed that people in Singapore participate in sports mostly for \r\nhealth and fitness. Many gave feedback that there is an immense untapped \r\nopportunity for people to enjoy the emotional benefits of sports. There is also \r\nopportunity for enjoying sports in more ways than one. Instead of just playing a \r\nsport, one can also watch, cheer, spectate and volunteer. The simple proposition \r\nfor Let's Play is 'sports energises life through its diverse offering of \r\nenjoyable moments and shared experiences'.""\r\n\xa0\r\nIn support of the 'Let's Play' movement, the SSC will rollout initiatives \r\nto make it easier, more accessible and fun to be involved in sports in more \r\nways.\r\n\xa0\r\nOne Stop Local Sports Portal to Facilitate Play and \r\nEntertain \r\nA one stop, integrated portal for the local sports scene? \r\nwww.singaporesports.sg has been launched to facilitate play and provide \r\nentertainment. The portal will make it easy for people to find out what sports \r\nevents are happening in town, where to play sports and book sports facilities \r\nonline, how to play sports, who to play sports with, where to find other online \r\nsports communities and have fun - all in one convenient online location. \r\nFor a start, the portal will feature eight sports and provide a platform \r\nfor the local sports community to meet, exchange ideas and learn from one \r\nanother. It will also include updated information on ways the general public can \r\nparticipate in sports, whether it is through major events, community initiatives \r\nor at Sports Recreation Centres (SRCs). They will be able to view delayed \r\nbroadcasts for certain sports tournaments, blog, subscribe to newsletters, get \r\nsports news articles and even find a sports ""kaki"" on the new portal. More \r\nsports will be added at a later date. \r\n\xa0\r\nEnhanced Sports Education Programme to Promote More Opportunities \r\nfor Play in Schools\r\nThe SSC introduced the Sports Education Programme (SEP) in primary schools \r\nto junior colleges in April 2007, to encourage sports participation in schools \r\nand increase sporting opportunities for the young. The programme was recently \r\nenhanced to include two new categories - Sports Development and Sports Leagues. \r\nThe Sports Leagues category provides opportunities for schools to organise \r\nintra-school competitions (e.g. inter-class competitions) that take place over a \r\nprolonged period of time, where participating teams have the opportunity to play \r\neach other (e.g. weekly or twice a week etc) in the chosen sporting activity. \r\nThis latest change will provide more play opportunities for every child, in \r\nsupport of one of the recommendations in the Sporting Culture Committee \r\nReport.\r\n\xa0\r\nSSC Sports Facilities to Take on a Fun Look, More Fields Open for \r\nPlay\r\nSingaporeans can also expect a more fun and lively look at the SSC's sports \r\nfacilities. Starting first with SSC's Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong West, \r\nTampines and Hougang SRCs by June 2008 and the rest of SSC's facilities by March \r\n2009.\r\nTo make play more accessible, the SSC has been working with its sister \r\nagencies to open up fields for public use. To date, there are 120 school fields, \r\nwhich are opened to the public for sports and recreational use, during weekends. \r\nThis is an increase of 70 school fields from 2007. Moving forward, even more \r\nfields will be opened up to the public for their use.\r\n\xa0\r\nFun publicity initiatives to increase the public's awareness of \r\n'Let's Play'\r\nIn order to communicate the 'Let's Play' movement to everyone in Singapore, \r\nthe SSC will be embarking on a publicity initiative starting with a television \r\ncommercial and advertisements in newspapers from 7 May 2008 onwards. There will \r\nbe even a contest at Orchard MRT where the public has to guess the sports \r\nfeatured. In addition, roadshows will be held at different venues around \r\nSingapore to entice the public to participate in sports.

""From TAFISA's point of view, 'Sajik Stadium' is better \r\nthan 'Asiad Main Stadium' because citizens can participate in other events which \r\nwill be placed outside of the Stadium. Sport for all is all about participation, \r\nnot just watching games."" </p>\r\n<p>Furthermore Mr. Baumann asked about Busan \r\ncitizen's interest in the Busan Games.

Through 2002 Busan Asian \r\nGames, the Soccer World Cup 2002 and the 2005 APEC Summit, Busan has been \r\nrecognized as a city that has a longstanding record and the capacity to \r\nsuccessfully hold sport events and conventions. The city located on the south \r\ncoast of Korea has all the necessary facilities, accommodations, and \r\ntransportation system and tourist attractions like beaches, mountains and \r\nhistoric sites. \xa0The Busan Games that are in the tradition of TAFISA's \r\nWorld Festival of Traditional Games held every four years since 1992 in Bonn \r\nwill also focus on new and innovative trends in sports as part of a Sports & \r\nLeisure Industrial Fair. The Busan Games has adopted new sports (e-sports and \r\nX-sports) which will enable it to be the world's largest sports and cultural \r\nevent integrated the traditional and future sports/culture beyond the barriers \r\nof age and generation.\xa0Significantly, for the first time the \r\n4th TAFISA World Sport for All Games are officially patronized by the \r\nIOC. It can be subsequently recognized as an important international sports \r\nevent realizing the Olympic Spirit. The organizing committee has obtained the \r\nsupport from several international organizations such as WHO, UN, UNESCO, ICSSPE \r\nand World Leisure Organization in collaborative relationship with TAFISA, which \r\nwill turn the event into the social sports and cultural Olympics for the global \r\nvillage in the 21st century beyond the existing frame of traditional \r\ngame and sports. \xa0In addition, the programs like World 10 Million Walk \r\nand Inline Skate Marathon will give us the opportunity to reconfirm the values \r\nof human coexistence and world peace through sports activities. These games \r\nunite various civilizations on one platform to make one and all aware of the \r\ndepth, variety and values of Olympism and achieve the global peace in this \r\nhi-tech century.\xa0This new paradigm of sports festival will provide a \r\nunique chance to the spectators to enjoy the participation together along with \r\nthe players, which will surely distinguish the 4th Busan TAFISA World \r\nSport for All Games from Olympics and World Games. According to the words of the \r\nTAFISA president, ""the World Sport for All Games will be a vibrant and \r\nentertaining experience bridging the gap between traditional games and popular \r\nsports"". The organizers are expecting delegations from 100 countries worldwide \r\nto present their typical traditional and popular sports including more than \r\n10,000 players and participants to a worldwide audience. \xa0Meanwhile, \r\nWorld Forum on Sports, Education and Culture and Sports Leisure Industrial Fair \r\nwill also be simultaneously held as its associated \r\nevents.\xa0\xa0<b>Traditional
