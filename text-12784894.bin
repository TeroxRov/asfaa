<p>Some 3,000 people got the opportunity to watch their favorite local and 
regional bands live on stage during the Nike+ Human Race 10K in Singapore on 
October 24th. </p>
<p> Mr Glenn Heng, 
Marketing Manager, Nike South East Asia and Singapore said, "The Nike+ Human 
Race has set itself apart from other races in Singapore by understanding how our 
runners love music and embrace the race concert as part of their celebration 
after the event. To heighten the celebratory moment, we are opening the race 
concert to the public to join in the fun and bring this event to a new level!"

<p>A highly energetic concert rounded up celebrations of the world's largest 
running event, held on the same day in more than 30 cities worldwide, with 
powerhouses Thaitanium (Thailand), Agrikulture (Indonesia), Estranged (Malaysia) 
Chicosci and Taken By Cars (Philippines) as well as local talents Composition B 
and Fire Fight taking to the stage.   Singapore is once again the only

worldwide.  The race this year started and ended at the F1 Pit building 
while bringing runners on a scenic route past Kampong Glam mosque, the National 
Stadium, Kallang Leisure Park, the Police Coast Guard and Kallang Water Sports
