<p>The Australian Government through the Australian Sports Commission and the 
Office for Women are encouraging women from across all levels of sport to apply 
for a share of $400,000 to pursue training and development in coaching, 
officiating, governance and management. </p><p>ASC CEO Mark Peters said the grants 
scheme recognises that Australian sport stands to benefit from a greater number 
of women in leadership and decision-making roles. 'The grants scheme provides 
chances for women to pursue accredited training in key areas of Australian sport 
including high performance coaching, officiating and management, where they tend 
to be under-represented,' Mr Peters said.   </p><p>'The grants also maintain a commitment to those women and sporting 
organisations in regional Australia, with more than 50 per cent of the grants 
being distributed to support the skills development and capacity building of 
regional sporting communities.'
  </p><p>'The programme has to date assisted more than 15,500 women from across 
Australia, with more than $2 million in Australian Government grants, to develop 
women's sport leadership skills and training.'
 
Grants are available in five key areas: high performance coaching and 
officiating; Indigenous women; women in disability sport; women from culturally 
and linguistically diverse backgrounds and women in general sport leadership. 
Funding of up to $5,000 is available to successful individual applicants, and up 
to $10,000 for approved 
organisations.</p>
