<p>More than 150,000 children are now playing sport, games and activities 
after school in the Australian Government's safe, fun and structured Active 
After-school Communities (AASC) program. </p><p>The Minister for Youth and Sport, Kate 
Ellis, joined thousands of kids around Australia to celebrate the milestone. 'To 
have 150,000 kids active, living healthier lifestyles and developing positive 
physical activity habits is a great achievement,' Ms Ellis said. "Participants 
are improving their motor skills, making new friends and developing a lifelong 
love of being physically active."
 </p><p>Ms Ellis said the AASC program had grown from 900 primary schools in 
Term 2 of 2005 to over 3,200 schools. "The competition for the attention of 
young people is intense. The growing use of the internet and video games 
presents a major challenge to get kids off the couch and active. To address the 
obesity crisis we need to ensure programs, like AASC, encourage more 
Australian's to develop healthy routines at a young age." Ms Ellis said 
principals, teachers and after-school care coordinators worked tirelessly to 
make the program work. "We are seeing some great results, but we are always 
looking for new ways to encourage more young people to embrace healthy and 
active lifestyles." </p>
