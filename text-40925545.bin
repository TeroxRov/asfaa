in Walk to Work Day by stretching her legs with CEO of Good Health Solution, Dr 
John Lang, and staff and Chairperson of the Pedestrian Council of Australia, 
Harold Scruby, in Sydney.</p>
<p>The Australian Government wants to encourage Australians of all ages to take 
some time tomorrow to go for a walk - and hopefully continue the habit as part 
of a regular exercise schedule. Physical activity is good for your health. By 
walking to work, parking further away, or getting off public transport a few 
stops early, Australians can help prevent high blood pressure, heart disease, or 
stroke - while also benefiting their mental health.</p>
<p>Around half of all Australians adults do not do enough physical activity. But 
a simple brisk walk for at least 30 minutes most days can have health benefits. 
Physical inactivity and poor diet are major factors in the increasing prevalence 
of overweight and obesity. More than half of all Australian adults are now 
overweight or obese. Physical inactivity and a poor diet are also risk factors 
for a number of chronic diseases including diabetes, heart disease, stroke and 
some cancers.</p>
<p>Walk to Work Day, established by the Pedestrian Council of Australia and 
funded by the Australian Government, encourages regular walking and physical 
activity by all Australians.</p>
<p>Walk to Work Day complements the Government's agenda for tackling obesity, 
which includes initiatives such as the establishment of the National 
Preventative Health Taskforce, $12.8 million to roll out the Stephanie Alexander 
Kitchen Garden program to 190 schools across the country, $46.8 million for 95 
community projects to provide sporting and recreational opportunities, $17.6 
million for 190 school and community groups under the Healthy Active Community 
and School program to promote healthy and active lifestyles, and support for 
<i>Heart Foundation Walking</i>, a program which encourages people to join 
community-based walking groups around Australia, which are 
free.</p>
