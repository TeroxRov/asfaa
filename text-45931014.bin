Assembly of ASFAA to be held in Israel in the year 2010.
 
We plan that the General Assembly will be held in month March 
2010.
 
We are interested to enable the participants of the General 
Assembly to participate in the International 2-day Gilboa walking event 
organized by Israeli Sport for All Association (ISFA).
 
The sittings of the ASFAA General Assembly will take place in the 
northern part of Israel in Sheraton Moria Hotel in the town Tiberias. This hotel 
is a 5 star hotel on the beach of Sea of Galilee.
 
In the north of Israel there are places sacred to Christianity, 
Moslem and Judaism. 
 
Israeli Sport for All Association (ISFA) will take care of all the 
required visa needed to enable the participants to enter and stay in Israel and 
participate in the General Assembly. 
 
We intend to organize a 2-day Journey in Israel to any delegate who 
will wish (like visits to Jerusalem, Bet-Lehem, Nazareth etc.).
 
In the next meeting of the ASFAA Board of Directors, in 2009, we 
shall give further and better particulars about our plans in regard to hosting 
ASFAA General Assembly 2010 in Israel.
