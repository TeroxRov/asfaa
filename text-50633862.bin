Back for the 19th year, the SAFRA Singapore Bay Run &amp; Army Half 
Marathon (SSBR & AHM) 2010 marked another first on the 12th September as 
70,000 runners streamed through the latest developments along the Marina Bay 
area in Singapore’s largest mass running event.
 
21km AHM & 10km Race – First To Run Past Marina Bay 
Sands
 
With an exciting twist to the running routes this year, participants of the 
21km AHM and 10km Race became the first to run past the Marina Bay Sands 
Integrated Resort along Bayfront Avenue.
 
Participants were well entertained and spurred on by a host of street-side 
festivities along the running routes at 16 different locations. Static 
festivities included stilt-walkers, fire twirlers, belly dancers and 
invigorating drumming performances, while Mobile Cheer Teams patrolled the 
running routes alongside runners on vehicles for the very first time to add to 
the carnival atmosphere.
 
Many also jumped up to hit the Giant High Five Palms suspended from three 
overhead bridges along the 21km AHM route at Nicoll Highway and Mountbatten Road 
to inject some fun into the run.
 
5km Fun Run – First To Run Along The Helix Bridge
 
After flagging off the non-competitive 5km Fun Run at 8am, Mr Teo Chee 
Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, who graced the event as 
Guest-of-Honour, also joined participants for the scenic run around the Marina 
Bay. Participants were treated to unbeatable sights of the Marina Bay area as 
they became one of the first to run along the world’s first curved double helix 
bridge and the Marina Bay Waterfront Promenade.
 
Better Welfare For Runners
 
Runners' welfare was well taken care of once again this year. Many stopped 
over at the six Salonpas Aid Stations conveniently co-located with the water 
points along the running routes to get a spray of Air Salonpas to relieve their 
tired and aching muscles during the run. Others enjoyed a good rubdown after the 
run at the Padang with Salonpas muscle relief products.
 
Jointly organised by SAFRA and Our Army, the SSBR & AHM aims to promote 
fitness and bonding among full-time National Servicemen, NSmen as well as the 
public. Since the event's name was changed from Sheares Bridge Run to SAFRA 
Singapore Bay Run & Army Half Marathon in 2007, the running routes have 
become closely linked with the development of the Marina Bay area. In 2007, the 
then brand new Floating Stadium was the end point for the event. In 2008, the 
run took participants past the newly opened Marina Bay Golf Course, and they 
also became the first to run across the Marina Barrage. Last year, participants 
continued to run past the F1 paddock area.
 
Brigadier General (BG) Lim Teck Yin, Vice President of SAFRA and Chairman 
of the Organising Committee for SSBR & AHM 2010, commented: "The SSBR and 
AHM is a unique opportunity where our NSFs and NSmen, as well as their families, 
can come together for a mass run annually. This not only underscores SAFRA and 
the Army's emphasis on maintaining a fit and cohesive defence force, but also 
the importance of families in the lives of our servicemen."
