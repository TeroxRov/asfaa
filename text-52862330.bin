successfully launched the second edition of SOD competitions at Doha Sheraton 
Hotel, under the motto of "Sport and Environment". 
The motto reflects the outstanding relationship that links sport with the 
environment, where human beings in general and athletes in particular should not 
be subjected to living in a polluted environment. 
The first annual SOD in 2007 was widely celebrated as an outstanding 
success, where it received an overwhelmingly response from locals and residents 
who interacted with different activities and events.
More than 70,000 students affiliated to different government, independent, 
private schools alongside foreign community schools took part in the 
competitions of the first annual SOD held under the motto "Sport for Health". 
The second annual SOD is expected to be an even greater hit than the previous 
year, in large part due to the exhaustive efforts of the SOD organizers, the 
Qatar Olympic Committee, Ministry of Education, Supreme Council of Education, 
Ministry of the Environment, and Environment Friends Centre. 
Prior to the launch of the second annual SOD competitions, chairman of the 
SOD's organising committee, HE Sheikh Saoud Bin Abdulrahman Al Thani commented 
"I have tapped a real desire and determination amongst our students to be a part 
of the upcoming Schools Olympic Day," and added that, "there has been a great 
response from all schools who declared their readiness to compete in the 
event."
His Excellency praised the efforts exerted by the organizers in attempt to 
secure a tangible success for the event, and confirmed that the program's vision 
aims to encourage the young generation to get involved in sport and adopt a 
healthy life style.
Sheikh Saoud called on all community members to get involved with the SOD 
program which aims to consolidate Olympic values while simultaneously increasing 
the spirit of friendship, respect and fair play. He also hailed efforts of all 
teachers, education and teaching staff in qualifying, training and encouraging 
students to take part in the program.
Communities worldwide have stressed the importance of the environment in 
our daily life. Overall human health correlates closely with the wellbeing of 
the environment, which makes the wellbeing of both inextricably linked. A core 
value of the Olympic movement is, in fact, maintaining a healthy environment. 

The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) study on the interaction 
between sport and environment has set a new criterion for the Olympic movement 
called "the third pile". Their findings have elevated the environment alongside 
sport and culture collectively to represent a main dimension for Olympism. The 
findings have also motivated the IOC to go to great lengths in order to ensure a 
healthy environment for future athletes.
Under the motto "Sport for the Environment", the second annual SOD will 
reinforce the country's efforts to protect the environment and encourage a 
healthy dialogue of environmental concepts in conformity with the QOC's overall 
strategy.
