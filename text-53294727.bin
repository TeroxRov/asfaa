New research of Australia shows that almost 50% of Australians 
aged over 15 participated in regular physical activity (at least 3 times a week) 
in 2009.
The 2009 Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey (ERASS) Annual 
Report reveals that an estimated 8.2 million people are involved in regular 
physical activity and that since 2001 regular participation has jumped 11 
percentage points, from 37% of the population aged over 15 in 2001 to 48% in 
2009'.
The survey also confirms that Australians are involved in a wide 
range of exercise options.
Around 40% of Australians aged 15 years and over participated at 
least three times per week in non-organised physical activity, 12.3% 
participated in organised physical activity and 6.4% in club-based physical 
activity.
In May the Government released Australian Sport: Pathway to 
Success, which outlines the new direction for Australian sport. This includes 
$195.2 million in new funding - the biggest funding injection to sport in our 
nation's history.A key plank of this new direction is the first Sport and 
Education Strategy to bring a new focus on the delivery of quality sport and 
physical education in schools to boost the number of our children participating 
in sport.
National Sporting Organisations (NSOs) will also be required to 
have an increased focus on participation outcomes as part of their funding 
agreements with the Australian Sports Commission (ASC) and the Government will 
boost funding opportunities for NSOs to grow grassroots participation through 
their community clubs.
The 2009 ERASS findings showed:
An estimated 8.2 million Australians (aged 15 years and over) 
were active at least three times a week, which represented 48% of the 
population.
Of these an estimated 4.8 million persons aged 15 years or over 
(28% of the population) were active at least five times per week.
Of those Australians who participate in regular physical 
activity, a greater proportion participated in non-organised activities compared 
with organised activities, 39% and 12% respectively.
In 2009, as with previous years, women were more likely than men 
to be regular participants (51% and 45%, respectively) except for those aged 15 
to 24 year olds where male participation was higher.Men were more likely to 
be active for longer periods per session.
Walking, aerobics, swimming, cycling and running remain the top 
5 non-organised activities for Australians.
The top 10 organised physical activities in 2009, in terms of 
total participation rate, were aerobics / fitness, outdoor football (soccer), 
netball, golf, tennis, basketball, Australian Rules football, outdoor cricket, 
lawn bowls and touch football.
