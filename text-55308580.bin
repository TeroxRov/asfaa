New Zealand children and young people should: 
· do 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical 
activity each day be active in as many ways as possible, for example through 
play, cultural activities, dance, sport and recreation, jobs, and moving from 
place to place 
· be active with friends and whanau, at home, school, and in the 
community 
· spend less than two hours a day (out of school time) in front 
of television, computers and game consoles."
Most New Zealanders know that it's important for adults to be 
active for at least 30 minutes a day. Children and young people need to be 
active for 60 minutes each day.
The aim is to complete moderate to vigorous exercise – that 
means an increased heart rate and some huffing and puffing. The 60 minutes can 
be completed all at once or in chunks throughout the day. 
This can include:
· playing games; 
· walking, running, or riding a bike to get from place to place; 

· playing sport or taking part in recreational activities; 

· participating in cultural activities like kapa haka; 
· working; 
· dancing;
Being active is a great way to spend time with family and 
friends, explore the local community, and to re-energise during break times at 
school.
<p>It's also important for young people to limit the amount of time they spend 
in front of TV, computers, and playing electronic games. This should be 
restricted to two hours a day (out of school time).</p>
