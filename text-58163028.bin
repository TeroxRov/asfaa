<p>Argentina, through it’s sport 
organization A.M.U.D.E.R.A., and after several years, welcomes once again the 
Sport for all spirit and its great ideal. For the first time ever in Latin 
America, the argentine capital city, Buenos Aires, will be hosting this 
important event. </p><p>On behalf of the whole Pan American sports community, we invite 
you to become a part of this magnificent movement that will most certainly fill 
you with joy and above all, will introduce a concept of constant activity, that 
will lead to a healthy life for all world communities. Are you wondering 
when you will have the opportunity to attend this event? The congress will take 
place in the city of Buenos Aires through September 25th to September 30th 2007, 
in one of the most prestigious hotels within Buenos Aires Down town. The 
main theme of the congress will be "Sport for all and world active cities and 
communities". </p><p>We expect, that throughout this congress, a profound cultural 
change will take place in every community, and will make them realize the 
benefits that sports and any kind of physical activity can have on everyday 
life. As more and more people practice sports, they will be happier, healthy and 
they will find themselves cooperating and interacting with a large group of 
individuals with similar goals. This will motivate communication, cultural 
exchange, relationships and respect, which most community’s lack of. </p><p>We, 
organizers, have already experienced, in our own country, all that has been 
mentioned before and after years of hard work we have achieved Argentina’s 
involvement in one of TAFISA’s main events. Due to this, the argentine 
authorities have once again a special interest in the Sports for All movement 
and are willing to promote this congress. This is why we offer you this unique 
opportunity in which you may learn new ways and techniques, on how to bring to 
your community the possibility of a healthy life throughout sports or physical 
activities.</p><p>This congress will be an excellent opportunity that you 
shouldn’t miss allowing you to become a fan of this international movement. 
All this, along with constant feedback and flow of information from TAFISA 
to the world and from every active city to TAFISA, will create a Sport for all 
network that will unite regions, cultures like no other ideal has achieved 
before. </p><p><b>Other themes that will be approached during the
