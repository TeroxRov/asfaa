The Australian Sports Commission's campaign 'Play for life...join a 
sporting club' has been launched right around the country, with enthusiastic 
support and endorsement not only from the sporting community, but also from 
schools, health professionals, child psychologists and counsellors, and the 
media.
 
Australian Sports Commission CEO Matt Miller said the campaign is a whole 
of sport initiative, involving state, territory and Commonwealth agencies 
working together to deliver long-term benefits to families around 
Australia.
 
'This campaign, which aims to highlight the benefits of club sport and 
increase participation, is already achieving remarkable outcomes at a community 
level,' he said.
 
Mr Miller said that that an estimated one million children - or 37 per cent 
of children aged between five and 14 - do not participate in any organised 
sport. This is in a country where one quarter of children are overweight or 
obese.
 
'The key for families is to find a sport that your child enjoys. You may 
not find the perfect fit first time, but persevere. There are so many options 
available today - bowls, archery, golf, handball, to the more traditional sports 
we associate with children such as cricket, tennis, football and netball,' Mr 
Miller said.
 
The Australian Medical Association's Dr Pesce believes there are strong 
links between playing a sport and maintaining good health and wellbeing.
 
'Providing opportunities for children to play sport can establish lifelong 
positive attitudes towards physical activity. These attitudes will be crucial if 
Australia is to tackle its increasing levels of obesity and chronic disease,' he 
said.
 
Around 150 'try a sport' days will be held in metro, regional and remote 
Australia to highlight the variety of local sports available. Hundreds of 
sporting clubs around the country are involved in these events, working with the 
Australian Sports Commission to provide a fun, free and safe introduction to 
sports and physical activities for thousands of children.
 
The campaign features a new website - ausport.gov.au/findaclub - that helps 
families easily find sporting clubs in their area. It also includes a 
communications campaign to general practitioners, school principals and primary 
school families around Australia, as well as a comprehensive media awareness 
component.
 
Johanna Griggs has been an outstanding ambassador for the campaign, sharing 
her passion and commitment to club sports with millions of Australians as she 
has launched the campaign in each state and territory and spoken to print, radio 
and television media.
 
'I'm proud to be an ambassador for Play for life...join a sporting club. It 
reflects my own journey with sport - a journey that has helped me get to where I 
am today. But more importantly, it reflects the positive role that sporting 
clubs play in my boys' lives ... for life,' she said.
