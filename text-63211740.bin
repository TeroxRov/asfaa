Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in the Field of Sport for All and 
Physical Activity. This MoU centres on TAFISA's provision of consulting and 
campaining in the field of international Sport for All and physical activity, 
and is a clear indicator of the growing international recognition of the 
importance of the Sport for All sector, and the IOC's support of TAFISA 
operating within this sector. The MoU focuses specifically on TAFISA's Certified 
Leadership Courses in Sport for All, and TAFISA's Active Cities – Active 
Communities - Active Citizens program, the "Triple AC". TAFISA extends its 
gratitude to the IOC, particularly Mr Christophe Dubi, Sports Director, and Ms 
Celine Moyat for their hard work in finalising this 
MoU.</p>
