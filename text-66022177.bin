<p>In today's technological and mobile society where millions of people own 
private cars and sedentary life patterns are predominant, walking is riding a 
wave of popularity. It draws its strength from a rediscovery of walking's 
utility, pleasures and health-giving qualities. Back to the roots seems to be 
the motive for many who are aware of the importance of walking as the basic 
physical activity, vital for well-being and health.Walking as a mass 
phenomenon occupies a dominant place in the world of active living!</p>
<p>The World Walking Day (WWD) merges the manifold efforts in the field of 
walking worldwide and stands for the common aim of TAFISA member countries and 
organizations from all continents to present walking as a worldwide movement 
above all as a means against obesity and inactivity. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has officially recognized the World Walking Day and gives 
morale support to the event by linking it to its on-going global annual 
initiative "Move for Health". The WWD is fundamental as the world faces the 
issues of global warming, terrorism and obesity.  Walking together locally, 
nationally and internationally can help contribute towards the solution of all 
these problems.</p>
<p>TAFISA's official launch of the World Walking Day was on the occasion of the 
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, June 7, 1992. Since then the event has been 
growing steadily in numbers of events and 
participants.</p>
