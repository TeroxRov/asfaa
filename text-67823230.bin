Satellite Centres for Sports Development (SCSDs), the Singapore Sports Council's 
(SSC) Let's Play movement was given further impetus with the commencement of 
operations of three SCSDs. </p>
<p>Targeted at youths aged six to 16, the SCSDs serve as the launching pad for 
them to learn new sports early in life in a safe, fun and friendly community 
setting. These sports include those being featured at the Singapore 2010 Youth 
Olympic Games (YOG). The SCSDs are being established in existing sports 
facilities such as schools, sports and recreation centres as well as community 
centres located in the heartlands. They will be coordinated and managed by the 
respective National Sports Associations of each sport.</p>
<p>At the Marina Barrage, which is the site of the SCSD for Sailing, the 
Singapore Sailing Federation (SingaporeSailing) lined up an armada of nearly 20 
sailboats to offer to the public free 20-30 minute rides around the Marina 
Reservoir. This was to encourage potential future sailors to take up the sport. 
Nearly 50 underprivileged children from homes / centres such as Boys' Town and 
Muhammadiyah Welfare Home were also brought on a tour of the Marina Barrage. 
</p>
<p>Young water enthusiasts who wish to take their interest in sailing one step 
further can sign up for sailing courses organised by SingaporeSailing. From 4 
July onwards, SingaporeSailing will be conducting their "SailFun" courses at the 
Marina Barrage.</p>
<p>"Singaporeans have heard of the many successful overseas exploits of our 
sailors. This is an opportunity for Singaporeans to try the sport out for 
themselves. Perhaps this experience may be the start of a lifelong passion, be 
it in competitive or recreational sailing," said Dr Ben Tan, President, 
Singapore Sailing Federation. "With Singapore being an island, it would only be 
natural that more Singaporeans have easy access to the sport, and 
SingaporeSailing would be happy to facilitate that."</p>
<p>The SCSD for Wrestling also took off with five youths being introduced to the 
sport of Freestyle Wrestling. The training model was devised by two-time Olympic 
and six-time World Champion wrestler, Sergei Beloglazov. The SCSD for Wrestling 
is located at the National Wrestling Centre / Asian Wrestling School at Upper 
Aljunied Road. </p>
<p>The SCSD for Basketball, located at Bukit Panjang Government High Indoor 
Sports Hall, commenced operations on 4 July 2010.</p>
<p>"We want to make all sports available to all youths in Singapore, including 
those who would otherwise not have the opportunity or resources to participate 
in sports," said Mr Bob Gambardella, Chief of Sports Development Group, 
Singapore Sports Council. He added, "The SCSDs will provide these such 
opportunities and resources for our youths to learn and play sports. This is 
synergistic with our Let’s Play movement, which seeks to encourage everyone in 
Singapore to embrace sports as a lifestyle choice. We are confident that the 
SCSDs will build on the legacy of the YOG by championing sporting values such as 
confidence, sportsmanship, respect and other lessons gained from an active 
sporting lifestyle."  </p>
