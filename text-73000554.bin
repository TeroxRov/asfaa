by one million last year from the 2007 total, according to the Exercise, 
Recreation and Sport Survey (ERASS) report, released recently.</p>
<p>Minister for Sport and Youth the Hon Kate Ellis said the latest ERASS 
findings showed an estimated 8.2 million Australians (almost half of the 
report's estimated population) aged 15 years and over were active at least three 
times a week, a rise from 7.1 million (43 per cent) in 2007.</p>
<p>Ms Ellis said that the number of Australians exercising regularly had risen 
by 12 percentage points since the annual study started in 2001.</p>
<p>'It's encouraging to see more Australians involved in sport and physical 
activity. These findings show regular participation increased from 37 per cent 
in 2001 to 49 per cent in 2008, a jump of 12 percentage points.</p>
<p>'This tells us we are gradually heading in the right direction, but these 
numbers have to improve further if Australia is to realise the health benefits 
of being a more active nation.</p>
<p>'The Australian Government is committed to improving participation levels 
through a number of broad and inclusive programs including Indigenous people, 
women, juniors, sporting clubs and people with a disability,'  said Ms 
Ellis.</p>
<p>The ERASS study found females were more likely to be involved in regular 
physical activity, registering 51 per cent compared with 47 per cent of males. 
However men were more likely to be active for longer periods.</p>
<p>Australia's most popular sports and physical activities included 
aerobics/fitness, golf, outdoor football (soccer), netball, tennis, touch 
football, basketball, Australian Football, swimming and outdoor cricket.</p>
<p>The Exercise, Recreation and Sport Survey, a joint initiative of the 
Australian Sports Commission and state/territory sport and recreation 
departments, collects information on the frequency, duration, nature and type of 
activities that are participated in by persons aged 15 years and over for 
exercise, recreation and sport, excluding coaching, refereeing and being a 
spectator.</p>
