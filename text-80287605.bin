disabilities in Fiji to enjoy the benefits and fun of organized sport and 
physical activity.
 
The Australian Government, through AusAID and the Australian 
Sports Commission (ASC), has committed $5 million over five years to roll out 
the Australian Sports Outreach Program in the Pacific nations of Vanuatu, Samoa, 
Kiribati, Nauru and Fiji.
 
In Fiji, the ASC has been assisting the Fiji Sports Association 
for the Disabled (FSAD) to introduce and coordinate inclusive sport activities 
in 17 special education centres across the country to benefit the health and 
wellbeing of more than 1060 children with disabilities.
 
Saimoni Nainoca, FSAD Sport Development Officer, said that one 
of their goals is to tailor activities to meet the needs of people with 
disabilities and create opportunities for them to participate in a greater 
variety of sports.
 
This includes assisting the Fijian sporting federations to 
develop and deliver inclusive activities such as wheelchair tennis, table 
tennis, archery and lawn bowls.
 
'It's wonderful to see so many more children with a disability 
in Fiji enjoying the benefits of sport, many for the first time,' said Mr 
Nainoca. 
 
'Sport is being used as a vehicle to help improve the lives of 
people with disabilities in Fijian communities, to highlight their skills and 
abilities, help them develop confidence, encourage personal independence and 
promote more positive attitudes amongst the general Fijian public.'
 
One of the main aims of the program is to help build the 
capacity of schools, sporting federations and disabled people's organizations in 
Fiji to deliver their own sporting programs for people with 
disabilities.
