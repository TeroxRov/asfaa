<b>By Encik Wan Yew Leong, former President of Pacesetters Athletic Club 
Malaysia.</b><b>OCM Conference to formulate OCM’s Strategic Plan 
2011-2016</b> The Executive Board of Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) 
decided that a strategic plan be formulated to chart the progress of OCM over 
the next 5 years. This task has been given to the Strategic Planning Committee 
chaired by the Deputy President, Y.Bhg. Datuk Dr. M. Jegathesan. The process of 
formulating the five year plan will start with a Conference with the Theme "From 
'good' to 'great' – taking OCM to New Heights". I find that the term "sports development" is not well understood as it usually 
refers to the churning out athletes in high performance sports. I feel sports 
development should be broad base, introducing & promoting the sports to 
individuals, from the young to the old, from those with more natural talent to 
those with lesser capabilities. This is where I feel failure among most NSAs. 
NSAs are very medals focused, measured by number of gold medals in regional 
games and I feel they could be obsessed with it at times. In their mission and 
goals, sports for all are excluded. <b>Of Foundation, Clubs and Sports 
for All</b>I like to comment on the role of clubs in sports development and 
inculcating sports for all. I was at the OCM Museum during the recent OCM Youth 
Leadership Conference and I saw on chart that I reproduce here to show the 
relationship of the sports structure globally.<b>Sports </b>Having taken a helicopter view from 30,000 feet above sea level, let's try to go 
to the ground and see what's happening. Since I am a recreational runner, I 
would use athletics as the example. Sports governance exists for the purpose of 
the sports to serve the athletes. The athletes usually are individuals or 
members of a sports club, in my case I am a member of Pacesetters Athletic Club, 
Malaysia.(PACM) PACM, in turn belongs to Federal Territory Amateur Athletic 
Association (FTAAA) which is the state sports association (SSA) for athletics 
governing the sports. FTAAA is affiliated to Malaysian Amateur Athletic Union 
(MAAU) (http://maau.net.blog) the national sports association governing 
athletics in Malaysia. MAAU is the only recognized athletic body in Malaysia 
that is affiliated to International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) 
(http://www.iaaf.org), the global body governing athletics. At the same time, 
MAAU is also affiliated to OCM, the coordinating body for all national sports 
associations. IAAF and OCM along with all other International Federations of 
other sports and various National Olympic Associations are affiliated to the 
International Olympic Committee (www.olympic.org) , based in Switzerland.The 
vision, mission and goal of MAAU are as 
follows;<i><b>VISION</b>The heartbeat of world-class athletics in 
the region<b>MISSION</b> To develop, produce and manage 
competitive world-class athletes who excel at the regional and world meets in 
order to bring honours to the country.<b>GOALS</b>Produce 
world-class athletes who excel at regional and world meets by 2012Develop, 
produce and maintain a strong back-up squad at all times.In close 
cooperation with NSC, set up centres of excellence with the necessary 
infrastructure that cater for the needs of athletes by 2008.Implement a high 
performance athletics system by 2006.In close cooperation with NSC, 
establish a national sports science centre and related sport science system by 
2010</i>While this article is not intended to critic MAAU’s Vision 
Mission statement, I can't help but find the sports for all piece is totally 
missing from the goals, it is all about high performance sports. I wonder 
whether sports for all are in the State AAAs’ goals. This perhaps partly 
explains the missing link in the sports clubs as sports clubs tend to be more 
recreational rather than high performance. Now why do I take so much 
pain to explain the relationship? It is my intention to dwell with the substance 
and form of this governing structure. The fundamental role of the NSAs is to 
govern and promote their sports. Therefore, if a certain sport in a country is 
not doing well, the buck stops at the NSA. In Malaysia, the NSAs promote their 
sports via the SSAs. This is where the problem lies, not all the SSAs are 
capable or active. Of course due consideration has to be given to small states 
like Perlis as compared to large state like Selangor, the population of the 
states, their demography will determine the popularity of the sports. Within the 
states we have the districts sports activities promoted by the state sports 
councils. The membership of the SSA is from the sports clubs. The strength and 
weakness clearly lies in the sports clubs. In many sports, especially in 
athletics, the clubs are few. Just use FTAAA as an example, I recall FTAAA 
having more than 130 affiliates of various clubs and associations back in the 
eighties when even my old boys association was a member. Now FTAAA has about 30 
affiliates and even these affiliates are by and large inactive. FTAAA is 
considered one of the strongest SSAs and you can imagine the situation in the 
smaller states. This problem is repeated in many other sports where the vacuum 
is greatly felt at the demise of the sports clubs, in short, the SSAs are 
hollow! A few years ago when we have Datuk Azalina as Sports Minister, the 
revival of the sports clubs is very much talk about at national level. However, 
the status of the issue is that we talked about it, nothing more! We can say 
today we have a big vacuum at the SSAs and the clubs. The role of the 
clubs is not just about development of sports at high performance level but 
fulfill the very important role of promoting sports for all, an equally 
important objective of OCM along with high performance sports. They also form a 
conduit for school leavers to further their sporting activities after they left 
schools. Tunku Imran, president of OCM spoke passionately that he rather sees 2 
million individuals running than having 5 gold medals. I would put in another 
way, if we have 2 million individuals running recreationally, we already have 
the cake. Should we also win the SEA Games Marathon gold medal, we then have the 
icing on the cake. Could you imagine having 2 million individuals running? It 
means that we become a healthier nation with fewer problems from lifestyle 
diseases. We would move closer to a sporting culture like in Australia. 
<b>Examples of Grass Root Development </b>I do have a little story 
to share on the role of clubs with Michelle Tan Bee Kiang as the case study. In 
2000 and 2001 when Michele was in Form 4 and 5, she ran with the Pacesetters 
Youth Program at Kampung Pandan under the guidance of Viviene Kartsounis and KK 
Oon. She did not have family support in pursuit of the sports. The club played a 
role here and she was supported via the New Balance Racing Team program as a 
back-up runner. On Sundays for the long runs, members of the Permaisuri Group 
such as Phoon Yoke Heng and a few others provided her with the transport to 
Bukit Aman Car-park where the Pacesetters train for their long runs. She took 
part in both the track and road events with some modest achievements. She wrote 
about her experience with the club in her article, "Thoughts of a young 
Pacesetter" (Footloose January 2001)I recall she joined me to run at a 
road race in Perak in 2001. On the way back, Jenny Lim (PACM ladies captain 
then) hitched a ride from us and while in my vehicle, Jenny advised her "You 
have strong legs, you should be able to train harder and improve" Michelle left 
the club after her Form 5 and further her studies in LLB. After her LLB, she 
re-emerged in the club and started training with the better runners, including 
the African runners. Today she is one of the top 3 runners in the women open 
category for marathon and 21km with a personal best time of 3hr 45mins for the 
marathon. The club cannot claim credit for her current achievements but the club 
did provided her a niche during her formative years when she was in Form 4 and 
5; that is factual. Another story I wish to share is on my third 
daughter, Karen. In her younger days, she is kind of a softie among my 4 girls. 
Her school in Subang Jaya is like any other schools now, rushing off their 
sports activities by the first few months of the year to focus on producing As 
in the public exams. She was lucky to get associated with a former basketball 
player turned coach by the name of Gary. He has the passion for the sports and 
gathered about 20 girls from a few schools to provide them the basic training 
with the intention to form a girl team for local competitions such as the 
Jasmine Cup. Over the last 2 years I witnessed her improvement in the sports and 
she ended by representing her district in the Inter-district Under 18 Basketball 
Competition, her team came out runners-up in 2009. In my housing area, Subang 
Jaya we also have a group of individuals who raise funds with some help from 
Datuk Lee Hwa Beng, assembly man of Subang Jaya then and MPSJ to build a covered 
basketball court in USJ14. This covered court comes with lights and can host 
tournaments without interruption by the weather. I appreciate the effort of this 
group of individuals and Gary towards providing my daughter and many kids in 
Subang Jaya an opportunity to play basketball beyond what the school can cater. 
<b>Build the Foundation</b>These two grass root stories gave hope 
towards a sporting culture and there are groups and individuals out there 
willing to contribute to sports mainly due to their passion for it. The SSAs 
need to engage with these groups, clubs and individuals and give them the 
appropriate support. Engagement with them via membership, affiliation, 
communication will be a good start towards building up a strong representation 
of the sports at district / state level. The SSAs should provide incubator 
service (helping clubs through the formative stage) to encourage more clubs to 
be formed and get affiliated to them to create a wider base of both recreational 
and high performance sports practitioners. When more of the states are strong, 
they become the foundation towards a stronger national body. When more of the 
national bodies are strong, their contribution towards national sports will be 
significant and OCM as a coordinating body can perhaps become great one 
day!
