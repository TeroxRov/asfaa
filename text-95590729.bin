support service to help get more women into positions of influence in New 
Zealand sport.
 
While more than 90% of all women and girls in New Zealand take part in some 
form of physical activity, the management and administration of sport is, on the 
whole, undertaken by men.
 
Fifty percent of New Zealand Olympic sports have less than 20% female 
participation on their boards. Even sports that attract equal numbers of female 
/ male participants such as triathlon and rowing do not have adequate female 
representation.
 
One of the members of the team managing the project to get more women 
involved is former NZOC Board member and International Squash Federation member 
Susie Simcock.  "Having women and men both represented at executive level is 
highly beneficial. Diversity leads to better decision-making and that's got to 
be good." "With the right support and direction playing a role at a community 
level can lead on to a management role within a national organization and, 
ultimately, on to a continental or international 
federation."
