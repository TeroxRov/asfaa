<p class="MsoNormal">The marathon was again
bursting at the seams again with 73,201 runners from more than 40 countries
registered to take part, but the number of no-shows – believed to be at least
8,000  – was expected to be even greater
this year because of the cold and windy conditions. An estimated 64,000 took
part, braving temperatures of around 12-14 degrees Celsius.</p>
