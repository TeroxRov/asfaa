<b>II</b><b>. </b><b>Actions and Measures</b>
 
7. To set up working mechanism with President as the leadership core, Board 
of Directors as the responsibility carriers in different posts and Secretariat 
as the coordinators.  
To encourage all the Board of Directors to play more active role in the 
Association development, each Director shall be defined with responsibilities 
for specific working areas according to the post requirements and the personal 
capacities. He/She is requested to submit report or provide information on sport 
for all development in his/her own country/region. In the meantime, the 
Directors are also responsible for coordinating with surrounding 
countries/regions to participate in the activities promoted by the ASFAA. By 
clarifying the responsibilities and strengthening cooperation, a scientific 
management model will be formed which brings higher efficiency and smooth 
operation of the Association.   
 
8. On one side, we shall encourage the various sport for all organizations, 
especially national and regional organizations to join in the ASFAA. On the 
other side, we shall enhance cooperation with governmental sport organizations 
and further strengthen the exchange with international and continental sport for 
all organizations. Following this way, the influence of the Association shall be 
expanded both at the governmental and worldwide level.  
 
9. To regulate the coordinated development of various sport for all 
activities.
Among the activities with large influence coverage and scale, a series of 
brand shall be recognized and further promoted. We shall make full advantage of 
the major cities in promoting the fitness building methods and the traditional 
sports especially those with characteristics of ethnic groups.  While taking an 
active part in the international sport for all activities such as International 
Challenge Day and World Walking Day promoted by TAFISA, we shall create new 
programs with our regional features and promote the brand of influential 
activities of our own.
 
10. To set up academic research base and management training base at a 
suitable time and suitable place.
3-5 qualified universities and institutions shall be selected as the 
academic research base and study on the hot topic in the field of sport for all 
and the issues of common concerns.  The periodic reports on academic findings 
shall be publicized for the members' reference and seminars organized for the 
information exchanges among members.  The member with high capacity and interest 
in hosting the ASFAA events shall be selected as the management training base, 
which serves as a platform to exchange management experiences and cultivate 
talented leaders in sport for all. It is hoped that the above measures will help 
upgrade the level of academic research and management in the field of sport for 
all in Asia and Oceania region.
 
11. To increase the popularity of the ASFAA name brand by organizing 
influential events and attract more sponsorship and partnership from the 
international and regional well-known enterprises.
Through marketing and sponsorship, the enterprises will benefit with 
increasing value of product brand and ASFAA will benefit with further promotion 
of sport for all in this region with the resources generated from these 
enterprises. Therefore, a long-term cooperation mechanism of mutual benefit 
between ASFAA and the enterprises will be formed.  
 
12. To put more efforts to strengthen the media promotion and create a 
favorable environment of public opinions. 
The ASFAA Newsletter and ASFAA Journal will continue to edit and publish 
regularly. The official website will be updated with profound content and varied 
forms. By establishing a press committee within ASFAA, the cooperation with 
media of various countries/regions will be reinforced. The website will provide 
with database of information and practice of different countries/regions, and 
members will learn from each other and draw upon various experiences. 
 
13. This Outline will be developed under the leadership of President and by 
the Board of Directors and the Secretariat, who takes charge of the 
implementation of the Outline. Each ASFAA member is requested to work out its 
own plans according to its different feature.
