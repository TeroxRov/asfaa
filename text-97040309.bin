from their television screens with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding 
(MOU) between the Singapore Sports Council (SSC), the Ministry of Education 
(MOE) and MediaCorp today at the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus (CHIJ) 
Secondary (Toa Payoh). This collaboration between the Singapore Sports Council, 
Ministry of Education and MediaCorp aims to build a strong sporting culture 
through wider exposure of youth sports and to give budding athletes support and 
encouragement.</p>
<p>The MOU was signed by Mr Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer for the 
Singapore Sports Council, Ms Sum Chee Wah, Director (Education Programmes) from 
the Ministry of Education and Mr Kenneth Liang, Executive Vice President, TV 
Programming and Production, Channel 5, MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd. Mr Teo 
Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Community Development, 
Youth & Sports and Ministry of Transport, Mr Masagos Zulkifli BMM, Senior 
Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Home Affairs, and 
Mr Lucas Chow, Chief Executive Officer of MediaCorp Pte Ltd witnessed the 
official signing ceremony.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, MediaCorp will broadcast highlights from the National 
School Sports Championships 2009 covering almost all of the 26 sports contested 
in the three age divisions in secondary schools and junior colleges from the 
quarter-finals onwards. The weekly 30-minute prime-time magazine show will 
include a summary of what has gone on in the week before as well as interviews 
and results of the various competitions. The 13-episode programme will air on 
MediaCorp Channel 5 from 4 March every Wednesday from 7:30pm - 8:00pm and is 
expected to wrap up in May when the competitions draw to a close. There will 
also be regular updates on the other MediaCorp platforms in print, radio and 
online.</p>
<p>The National School Sports Championships is a prominent fixture among the 
schools with more than 55,000 students taking part on an annual basis. </p>
<p>Ms Sum Chee Wah, MOE's Director of Education Programmes, says, "MOE is 
delighted that the vibrant and exciting inter-school competitions will be 
captured and broadcast to a national audience. There are 26 sports competing in 
the National School Sports Championships and the school sports competitions are 
currently the most structured and extensive local platform for youth sports 
exposure and talent development. This is a wonderful platform to showcase the 
sporting talents in our schools and a useful vehicle for building a strong 
sporting culture among our youths." </p>
<p>The timing of the project is most opportune as the nation gears up for the 
hosting of the inaugural Asian Youth Games 2009 and Youth Olympic Games 2010 in 
Singapore. The broadcast of the weekly sports programme will be the perfect 
platform for the Singapore Sports Council to further increase the awareness of 
sports among the public ahead of both major sporting events.</p>
<p>"This collaboration is a significant milestone in SSC's masterplan to develop 
a vibrant sports culture and grow the sports media sector in Singapore," says Mr 
Oon Jin Teik, Chief Executive Officer, Singapore Sports Council. For the first 
time, the energy, excitement and emotions that are seen at the National School 
Championships will be presented to a national audience on a regular basis 
through multi platforms such as television, radio, print and new media. We hope 
this will rub off on everyone in Singapore and encourage greater sports 
participation - be it as a participant, spectator, supporter or sponsor - as we 
ramp up and prepare to host the inaugural Asian Youth Games in 2009 and Youth 
Olympic Games in 2010. We are very fortunate to be able to work with two great 
partners to ensure the success of this project."</p>
<p>"MediaCorp is pleased to partner the Singapore Sports Council and the 
Ministry of Education to give local sports a wider and more prominent exposure 
to Singapore viewers. For the first time, we are producing a regular series on 
the national school sports championships. With this programme, we hope to 
promote greater sporting interest among Singaporeans and to showcase the many 
and varied talents in our schools today," says Mr Lucas Chow, Chief Executive 
Officer, MediaCorp.</p>
<p>Filming will begin at the end of February 2009, and the sports to be featured 
include badminton, swimming, basketball and table 
tennis.</p>
