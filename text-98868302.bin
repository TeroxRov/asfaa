<p> A consultancy study, "Sport for All - Participation Patterns of Hong Kong 
People in Physical ctivities", commissioned by the Community Sports Committee of 
the Sports Commission revealed that over 60% of the respondents (65.5%) 
indicated they have participated in sports for at least once during the three 
months of survey period. The study, successfully interviewed more than 5 000 
respondents, found that the male participation rate in sports is 68.4%, slightly 
higher than the 62.9% for the female. The survey also showed that with the 
increase in age, the sport participation rate dropped significantly from 95.6% 
(aged 7 to 12) to 53.3% (aged 60 or above).</p>
<p>    On the frequency of sports participation, 41.2% of the 
respondents (27.0% of the population) indicated that they had participated in 
sports three times or more per week, and 80.3% (52.6% of the population) for at 
least once per week. The sports they participated in most frequently were 
jogging (13.8%), swimming (13.2%) and badminton (10.1%). The three sports they 
were most eager to learn were swimming (14.7%), tai chi (10.3%) and badminton 
(8.8%).</p>
<p>    More than half of the respondents (60.6%) used mainly 
the leisure facilities of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) or 
other government departments. The first three considerations for the people to 
choose a sport to learn were "interest" (40.7%), "keeping fit/health" (21.3%) 
and "time available" (11.6%). "Facilities" (4.8%) and "cost" (2.9%) were not 
their primary considerations.</p>
<p>    About half of the respondents (46.9%) usually played 
sports with friends/ neighbours, 40.8% played sports alone and 13.1% with 
classmates.</p>
<p>    Apart from studying people's sport participation 
pattern, the study also covered their participation in physical activities. 
"Physical activities" refers to all physical activities that consume energy, 
including daily activities such as walking, housework, gardening and job-related 
manual work, and sports which require physical exertion and skills for the 
improvements of health and physique.</p>
<p>    The study revealed that over half (51.4%) of the Hong 
Kong people failed to meet the level of the "baseline indicator" of physical 
activity level. The "baseline indicator" is set at a level of as least an 
accumulation of 30 minutes a day and at least three days a week in moderate or 
vigorous physical activities. "Moderate intensity activities" refer to physical 
activities that slightly speed up one's breathing and heart rate and cause mild 
sweating without feeling exhausted, and that is still in a state of capable of 
talking smoothly. Examples are brisk walk, jogging, walking stairs, slow cycling 
or dancing.</p>
<p>    The primary reasons for the respondents' participation 
in physical activities included "keeping fit/health" (35.9%), "interest" (12.9%) 
and "physical activities/sports is a habit in daily life" (11.6%). The reasons 
for not taking the initiative in participating in physical activities included 
"no spare time due to work/study" (30.7%), "tired" (17.5%) and "lazy" 
(14.6%).</p>
<p>    More than half of the respondents (57.4%), especially 
the younger ones aged seven to 12 (72%) or the elderly aged 60 or above (77.7%) 
considered that they had sufficient or very sufficient amount of physical 
activities. However, if measured by the "baseline indicator", only 48.6% of the 
people reached the activity level of the "baseline indicator". It showed that 
there was a significant gap between self-evaluation and objective assessment on 
the amount of physical activities.</p>
<p>    The consultancy study "Sport for All - Participation 
Patterns of Hong Kong People in Physical Activities" was conducted in two 
stages, namely literature review and questionnaire survey.</p>
<p>    The LCSD appointed the Department of Sports Science 
and Physical Education of The Chinese University of Hong Kong as the consultant 
in September 2007 to undertake a literature review, supervise the implementation 
of the survey and prepare a comprehensive final report. The Literature review 
began in January 2008 with the collection of sports development data and related 
studies of Hong Kong and ten countries/regions.</p>
<p>    In April 2008, the LCSD appointed the Consumer Search 
to conduct a household survey for the second stage of the study. The survey was 
carried out from May 22 to July 10, 2008 (first phase), followed by other 
carried out from September 2 to October 19, 2008 (second phase).</p>
<p>    More than 5 000 people were successfully interviewed. 
Of the total respondents, 48.7% were male and 51.3% were female, matching the 
gender distribution of Hong Kong's population.</p>
<p>    Speaking at the press conference held today (September 
2) to announce the findings of the survey, the Chairman of the Community Sports 
Committee (CSC), Mr Chau How-chen, said the CSC endorsed six strategies for 
promoting community sports. One of them is to formulate objective indicators to 
measure the effectiveness of the promotion of Sport for All in the community. 
Through the conduction of a large-scale study, information on the extent, 
frequency and other data on the participation patterns of Hong Kong people in 
physical activities were collected so as to objectively measure the level of 
penetration of Sport for All in the community. The purpose is for a better grasp 
of the updated information of people's participation in physical activities so 
as to serve as references for formulating community sports strategies in the 
future. He emphasised that as far as promotion of Sport for All was concerned, 
this study is one of the important achievements of the six 
strategies.</p>
<p>    A task force, formed under the CSC with Dr Lo Wing-lok 
as convener, was responsible for survey-related issues. Speaking at today's 
press conference, Dr Lo said that the data collected by the study, particularly 
information on physical activities and the "baseline indicator", were valuable 
references for future promotion work of community sports.</p>
<p>    Based on the findings, the CSC proposed cooperation 
among the stakeholders in the community to disseminate the message on the 
importance of regular participation in sport and other physical activities. It 
was also proposed to review the provision of a greater variety of leisure 
activities and facilities for the public with a view to achieving the objective 
of Sport for All.</p>
<p>    Speaking at the press conference about the follow-up 
action, Assistant Director of LCSD, Miss Olivia Chan, said that based on the 
findings, the CSC proposed that to further promote Sports for All in the 
community, emphasis should be made to "education" and "service". Through 
education and upgrading services from time to time, more people will be 
encouraged to actively participate in sports and physical activities.</p>
<p>    She said that follow up action will be taken into two 
phases. The first phase will focus on introducing the findings of the study to 
various stakeholders including government departments, District Councils, 
National Sports Associations (NSAs), district sports associations, business 
organisations and schools; enlist their support to promote "Sport for All" in 
the community; and to disseminate messages on the importance of regular 
participation in sport and other physical activities to the public through 
various channels. The promotional work will be a continual process targeting 
different stakeholders and user groups.</p>
<p>    The focus of the second phase is to conduct a 
comprehensive review on the existing provision of leisure services, including 
the composition of the sports programmes and the public needs for sport 
facilities. A wider range of sports and other physical activities to cater for 
the needs of different age groups will be designed in consultation with NSAs. 
Similar study will be conducted regularly to collect the most update information 
of people's participation in sports and physical activities. The executive 
summary of the study has been uploaded onto the LCSD's homepage www.lcsd.gov.hk 
for public view.</p>
